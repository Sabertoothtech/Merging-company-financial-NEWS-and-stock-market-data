The Indian group supplies drugs to the Cape Town-based company, but has never owned a stake.""It would be prudent for Cipla Medpro\'s board to go back to Cipla Ltd and try a get a better deal to reflect this contract win,"" said one banker, not involved in the process.The Johannesburg stock market is already betting on a sweetened offer from the Indian firm, which has the second largest share of India\'s $13 bln drug sector.Cipla Medpro shares are about 4 percent above Cipla\'s proposed 8.55 rand offer price.The Indian company\'s so-called ""south-south"" takeover bid shows the attractions of South Africa\'s high-growth markets and rising population for drug companies focused on low-priced medicines that are off patent.The deal would give Cipla Ltd more clout in South Africa, where the government is introducing a national health insurance plan heavily reliant on the use of generic drugs.Cipla swooped in November when Cipla Medpro was under a cloud after chief executive Jerome Smith quit following allegations of awarding payouts without board approval.Its shares were then about 7.7 rand each, putting Cipla\'s offer at a premium of about 11 percent.Analysts and industry rivals said Cipla Ltd\'s price was ""opportunistic"" in the wake of the CEO scandal.""Given the inherent prospects of the business, I don\'t think Cipla Ltd would get 51 percent at this price, they are going to have to offer more,"" said Anthony Clark, an analyst at Vunani Securities.Just days after Cipla\'s bid proposal, Cipla Medpro was awarded a 1.4 billion rand ($159 million) share of a $667 million government two-year contract to supply of HIV/AIDS drugs to public hospitals.Analysts estimate Cipla Ltd stands to get revenues of $30-40 million annually from the contract if it gains control of Cipla Medpro.SUPPLY AGREEMENTBut some analysts said Cipla Medpro cannot afford to get too tough over the bid price because the company relies so heavily on the Indian firm\'s commitment to supply the bulk of its medicines.The supply deal was spearheaded by Smith, the former CEO and founder of the company. There had been speculation Smith\'s departure could affect Cipla Medpro\'s relationship with Cipla.The success of the takeover would remove these doubts and cement the relationship.""Cipla Medpro is worth more with a 51 percent shareholding, as it reduces the market\'s concerns regarding the sustainability of the supply agreement,"" said Mathew Menezes, an analyst at Avior Research in Johannesburg.']"

After four quarters of steady improvement, the company was expected to maintain its growth momentum, but its poor showing in the domestic market, which contributes half of the company's top line, led to growth rates being much lower than estimates.For Cipla, its net sales growth of 19% and operating margin of 24.3% are the lowest in the past three quarters. The stunted growth of 10% in the domestic market was in line with the weak growth of the industry in the quarter to December. Substantially lower sales ofLexapro, an exclusivity opportunity that Cipla shared withTevain the previous quarters, also led to a sequentially lower growth in its exports business.The company is in a transition phase with changes in its business model aided by induction of new talent in the company.Outside India, Cipla traditionally has been operating through marketing partnerships with manufacturing done in India. The company is changing this model and switching to the more conventional and lucrative model of creating its own frontends in the developed markets rather than relying on its partners.The company since this fiscal has started filing drug applications on its own, appointed senior professionals and set up subsidiaries in the key markets. It has filed five ANDAs (abbreviated new drug applications) in theUS markettill now. It is investing in ramping up the front-ends in the overseas market  which results in higher expenses in the near term, but would assure more long-term benefits. Consequently, as the company's management points out in the earnings call, the company's earnings profile will change from one of a consistent performer to one that is similar to most of its peers characterised by volatility in earnings due to exclusive opportunities.Investors must brace themselves for these changes. The management in the earnings call has maintained the guidance at a conservative 15% growth rate this fiscal.Cipla, in the first nine months of this fiscal, has grown its revenues 22%.

""South Africa is not the only market for us to grow. Our new CEO will take a call on whether to proceed with the deal or not,"" added Hamied.Medpro, which bought all its bulk drugs from Cipla, has been embroiled in controversy over the past one year with the sacking of its CEO and founder Jerome Smith by the board for financial mismanagement.

However, analysts say that it\'s probably a good move by Cipla to put the deal on hold, especially in a market that\'s mostly dominated by AIDS andmalariadrugs.Typically, Indian drug companies have always been prudent in their buyout efforts and have stayed away from acquisitions that would have drained cash off their books.

Cipla intends to delist Cipla Medpro from JSE on successful completion of the transaction.Cipla had also said that its Rs 10 offer was at a 46.7 per cent premium on the value of Cipla Medpro\'s share price in May 2012, when speculation around the takeover bid first started.Moyo said there have been significant change since then, particularly the lucrative Rs 1.45 billion tender won by Cipla Medpro for the supply of anti-retroviral drugs to the South Africa government.""The BEE shareholders would like to be part of the future and we will be having discussions with Cipla India to see how we can deal with this,"" Moyo told the weekly.The Board of Directors of Medpro have recommended to its shareholders to vote in favour of the offer, Cipla had said.The Public Investment Corporation, which holds a 4.94 per cent BEE stake in Cipla Medpro, had earlier indicated that it was in favour of the buyout, the report said.Sweet Sensation 67 (Pty) Limited (Sweet Sensation), the group of thirteen BEE (black economic empowerment) consortiums that invested in Enaleni (now Cipla Medpro South Africa Limited) currently has an 18.4 per cent shareholding, Cipla Medpro South Africa website says.']"

""I told myself that never again will I come to India without saying a thank you,"" he said to applause from members of a 600-plus audience, including some of India Inc\'s leading CEOs, businessmen and strategists.The event was private sector bank Kotak Mahindra\'s inaugural lecture series in the city. More than 10 years ago, drug maker Cipla sharply cut prices of generic anti-HIV medicines, dramatically transforming the fight against the dreaded disease.Cipla\'s prices were considerably cheaper than the patented drugs sold by multinationals , pushing many governments of poorer countries in Africa and Asia to adopt generics to treat AIDS patients. Clinton\'s remarks come a few weeks after the Supreme Court reinforced the primacy of generics in the fight against life-threatening diseases by refusing to grant a patent to Novartis\' blood cancer-busting drug Glivec.The ruling has been sharply criticised by multinational companies. Clinton cautioned against the current global economic model which favoured capital over labour and rewarded people for their ideas, innovation and entrepreneurship . Some times, this creates too much inequality, which is a severe constraint to growth.India, he added, is the ultimate paradox with its burgeoning middle class and an equal number of people living in poverty. ""We have to move to a level of shared prosperity for all,"" he said, echoing in some respects the campaign speeches he made on behalf of President Obama in last year\'s battle against Mitt Romney and also the Indian government\'s own efforts to promote a more inclusive agenda.CLIMATE CHANGE A DANGER: CLINTONClinton warned that climate change caused by rising greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is a clear and present danger for all mankind. Studies showed that Mumbai and Kolkata are among the two cities most vulnerable to rising sea levels, he said. ""We produce and consume energy in a way which is not sustainable or economical,"" he added.In an expansive mood, Clinton answered a number of questions from Uday Kotak, chairmanKotak Mahindra Bank, on a range of subjects after the speech. He said India should strive to improve relations with Pakistan.India and China, he said, should learn to copy each other\'s strengths, which in India\'s case would be the rapid pace of infrastructure creation in China. The government in China, he said, should attempt to promote more openness.He said the perception among some Indians that Republicans are more friendly towards India than Democrats could be due to some internal issues within the Democratic Party on trade, jobs and nuclear non-proliferation. Many grassroots groups and organisations within the Democratic party viewed increased trade with suspicion, thinking it could lead to loss of American jobs, he said.']"

To begin with, though he has spent his entire life overseas, he has a deep knowledge of Sanskrit, the Vedas and Vedanta. And he speaks half a dozen global languages, including French, German and Russian.Subhanu, 48, who has a graduate degree in engineering from Oxford University and an MBA from INSEAD, France, joined in February after CMD and promoter Y K Hamied decided to step down as MD after a 50-year-long stint. Hamied is credited with developing affordable generics of exorbitantly priced medicines , and particularly for launching an AIDS cocktail drug at less than a dollar a day, which revolutionized its treatment a decade ago. Cipla has grown from sales of a mere Rs 50 lakh in 1960, ranked below 50th in the domestic retail market, to over Rs 6,000 crore now, cornering the secondlargest market share.Subhanu comes to Cipla with a diverse work experience across sectors, companies and locations such as Europe, North America, Africa and Asia. In his last assignment, he led the global product strategy at Swiss major Novartis, with responsibility for marketing, sales, global medical affairs and health economics.Having lived and worked in culturally diverse places across the globe, he says, ""The biggest challenge wherever I have been is how to connect with people from different cultures and backgrounds and align them to excel around a common purpose."" In his responsibilities across global locations, his proficiency in several languages served him well. ""I think it\'s vital for a leader to get to know the heart and soul of the people they work with. If you do that and connect, you can help people do extraordinary things,"" he said in his first ever media interaction after taking over at the helm of India\'s fifth-largest pharma company.Though the soft-spoken Subhanu left India as a child  all of three  his love for India and its culture is very apparent. After his graduation , he learnt Sanskrit at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, London from teachers who came from Mattur in Karnataka . Through them, he met gurus again from Mattur, who taught him about the Vedas and Vedanta. (Mattur in Karnataka has a \'Sanskrit\' village where people converse in the ancient Indian language). His roots are deeply ingrained in Lucknow, clearly evident from his diction . Besides, he feels an emotional connect with the city, like most NRIs. Ask him to recite his favourite verse, and he rattles off:Amantram aksharam naastiNaasti moolamanaushadhamAyogyah purushonaastiYojakas tatradurlabhah(There is no letter or sound that cannot become a sacred mantra. There is no plant that cannot become a life-saving medicine. There is no such thing as an unworthy person. The person who can bring out such qualities, however, is rare.)']"

ABLE has raised questions on whether Cipla has complied with norms of selection for reference products, manufacturing process, quality-based considerations and clinical trial requirements.""All biosimilar players in India are following the Guidelines on Similar Biologics as part of the regulatory requirement and we are hopeful that the application for biosimilar Etanercept has also satisfied the same,"" Murali wrote to the drug controller in a letter, which ET has access to.""It would be truly unfair if a different yardstick has been followed for approval of this biosimilar Etanercept,"" he added.A Cipla official, however, has rubbished ABLE\'s contentions, maintaining that the company followed the rule book while launching the drug. ""We have not flouted any norms,"" said a top Cipla official who did not wish to be quoted since he\'s not authorised to speak to the media.One of the biggest worries for the association is the fact that Cipla has sourced the drug from its Chinese partner, and people from the biotech industry believe that while sourcing it, Cipla may not have followed certain norms. ""These are Chinese products marketed in India, and it looks like there has not been any comparative study or vetting done for this product,"" said an MD of a large biotech drug company, who did not wish to be quoted.']"

If you look at the results so far, the top pharma companies were placed in a much sweeter spot considering the huge amount of growth seen in the generic market. So, being stock-specific makes sense.Within the pharma space, we likeSun Pharmaas it has got plenty of opportunities, especially after the DUSA and theURLacquisition that can be margin accretive for the company from FY14-FY15 onwards.Also, with the ANDA application (Abbreviated New Drug Application) that Sun Pharma has got alongwith the kind of cash in its books can be value accretive from an earnings perspective.Having said that,Lupinfrom the top tier space also looks quite good. It is looking possibly at around $48 billion worth of drugs that can potentially be targeted at the US markets per se. Hence, pharmastockslike Lupin, Sun Pharma andCiplafrom the large cap space looks extremely good.I think,Dishman Pharmafrom the midcap space posted an excellent set of numbers. Hence, considering the kind of growth trajectory that Dishman and Glenmark are laying out for the near future, makes them a promising bet on declines from the midcap pharma space. But the pharma policy will have implications once it is implemented. So, investors should possibly buy all these stocks on declines and keep on accumulating them.']"

While the company has been growing ahead of the market, a sustained slowdown in this business will make it difficult for the company to maintain its growth trajectory. High base year effect is likely to catch up in the coming quarters - leading to moderation in growth rates. This also confirms with the company's moderated growth guidance of 18-20 % for the current fiscal.On the other hand, Cipla, with half of its revenues earned from the domestic market, bucked the trend and performed reasonably well on the home turf for the quarter to June. The 19% growth in consolidated revenues was driven by a 17% growth in the domestic market and 21% growth in its international business. Despite a high base effect and the trade-related challenges concerning the new drug pricing policy, the company registered a betterthan-industry show aided by the growth in anti-asthma, anti-infectives and cardiovascular therapy segments.However, the adverse impact of the pricing policy, to the extent of 2-3 % of revenues, may be felt in the coming quarters. Thanks to higher other operating income, the operating margin expanded 180 bps to 30%, despite most key expenses like raw material and employee cost increasing higher than the revenue growth. This surprisingly strong show for the first quarter, even if an aberration, is likely to help the company get a good start to achieve its revenue growth guidance of 14% to 15% for the current fiscal.""]"

While the company has been growing ahead of the market, a sustained slowdown in this business will make it difficult for the company to maintain its growth trajectory. High base year effect is likely to catch up in the coming quarters - leading to moderation in growth rates. This also confirms with the company's moderated growth guidance of 18-20 % for the current fiscal.On the other hand, Cipla, with half of its revenues earned from the domestic market, bucked the trend and performed reasonably well on the home turf for the quarter to June. The 19% growth in consolidated revenues was driven by a 17% growth in the domestic market and 21% growth in its international business. Despite a high base effect and the trade-related challenges concerning the new drug pricing policy, the company registered a betterthan-industry show aided by the growth in anti-asthma, anti-infectives and cardiovascular therapy segments.However, the adverse impact of the pricing policy, to the extent of 2-3 % of revenues, may be felt in the coming quarters. Thanks to higher other operating income, the operating margin expanded 180 bps to 30%, despite most key expenses like raw material and employee cost increasing higher than the revenue growth. This surprisingly strong show for the first quarter, even if an aberration, is likely to help the company get a good start to achieve its revenue growth guidance of 14% to 15% for the current fiscal.""]"

""Fire in the Blood"", which was screened here by the Ministry of External Affairs, depicts mass devastation in Africa, Asia and other parts of the global South due to obstruction of low cost anti-retroviral drugs used for the treatment ofHIV/AIDS. ""The right to live should not be dependent on the ability to pay, lives cannot be sacrificed at the altar of corporate profit and greed,"" Hamied said.The US pharma lobbies are pressuring their government to take action against India. They are alleging that Indian IPR laws discriminate against American companies. They have raised concerns regarding Swiss pharma majorNovartis AGlosing the legal battle for getting its blood cancer drug Glivec patented in India. They have also raised concerns over issuance of compulsory license by Indian government to a domestic firm.Calling the pharmaceutical industry a \'healthcare custodian\' of the world, Hamied offered technology transfer to produce affordable drugs to the developing countries.""I do believe that countries should take up this offer from India to provide technology to the developing world. The multinational companies are however are not interested in this type of transfer of technology to the developing world and therefore i strongly believe that countries should look at India to provide both technology and raw materials that go go into the manufacturing of healthcare products,"" Hamied said. The campaign to fight HIV AIDS by the company way back in 2000 has helped to save over 10 million lives in Africa alone, he added.He said: ""The AIDS initiative that Cipla pioneered has approximately saved almost 10 million lives in Africa alone. Today India produces 92 per cent of all the AIDS drugs formulations worldwide, selling them at a price of around US$ 1 billion.

Excerpts:ET Now: Your margins are at a seven-year low. I am sure the ring of that is not very pleasing for Cipla.Rajesh Garg:Our total growth for the year was 22% and our margins are in line with our expectations. The year ended at 21% margin.ET Now: I understand that your margins are in line with what you have indicated. I am just looking at a Credit Suisse report which seems to be indicating that margins are at a seven-year low. So my question is: why is that happening? Cipla is a great brand. You have a strong presence in the domestic market. Your exports are doing rather well. There is nothing wrong with the numbers in terms of top line. I am just curious about the margins.Rajesh Garg:There was one off impact from the last quarter last year when we had a one off payment which impacted the margins and then there is a mix impact from higher sales of antiretrovirals. But for the year, we ended where we wanted to and it was in line with expectations of around 21% and as we go out for the next year, we are well in line to deliver similar margins for 2014-2015.ET Now: In the conference call, you were indicating that margins will move back to the 20% mark in FY15. What is the company's strategy for getting there?Rajesh Garg:We have several strategies. One is the whole growth phase in terms of securing India and South Africa which are our home markets and as you saw in India, our business has done extremely well with 17% growth while the market has grown at less than half of that and our market share in India has expanded from 4.7% to 5.3% as per IMS in the last six months.In South Africa our business has done well. There was some impact last quarter from the depreciation of the ZAR, the rand in South Africa, but overall we have got terrific productivity gains happening all across in manufacturing. In R&D;, we have seen 30% productivity gains as we have really morphed our excellent scientific and R&D; team into actually integrated product development team.The overall year is well intact and as we have looked our April and May performance, we believe we will be able to get the full year 2014-2015 closer to what we ended 2013-2014 with.ET Now: Just want to get back to Medpro. How is that working out for you, what is the kind of sales, margins and profit contribution that you saw in the fourth quarter?Rajesh Garg:Cipla Medpro is doing excellent. They are growing ahead of the market. They are gaining market share. So they grew like 13%, but obviously there is an impact in dollar terms because of the depreciation of the rand. But it is commendable to see how despite going through the integration which is now almost complete, we have a new CEO, Paul Miller, with over 20 years pharma experience in place.The whole integration of excellent front end for us has happened. Our acquisition business case is well on plan, obviously there will be earnings accretive to us in two years and we are now in around less than a year since we acquire them.""]"

It is highly unusual for the courts to send such cases for mediation at such a late stage in the proceedings, particularly since the trial has concluded in this case. While the court may have done so to save time and resources, India has lost an opportunity to evolve patent jurisprudence on an important matter,"" said patent expertShamnad Basheer.There is always a chance of the mediation failing, in which case it will have to be heard by the court again, Basheer added.The outcome of this case has been keenly awaited also because it was expected to set a precedent for at least 10 similar cases pending against other generic firms on the same drug.The head of theintellectual propertydivision of a rival generic company said on the condition of anonymity, ""This is the first instance in the Indian pharma space when such a high-profile patent legal wrangle fought so bitterly in courts has gone for settlement through mediation, and this development comes as a huge surprise to me. The contours of the settlement will be very keenly and closely watched by the entire industry if both companies manage to find a common ground.""Soon after Cipla announced its intent to launch a generic version of Erlotinib at Rs 1,600 a tablet, compared to the innovator\'s selling price of Rs 4,800 per tablet, Roche sued the generic firm for patent infringement in January 2008. Roche had been granted a patent in India on Erlotinib in 2007. Cipla counterclaimed and argued that Roche\'s patent was invalid and its own generic version didn\'t infringe the innovator\'s patent.Over 2009 and 2010, Roche also sued a number of other generic drug firms includingNatco Pharma, Dr Reddy\'s,Glenmark, Oncare Life Sciences, Aureate Healthcare, Innova Life Sciences and Accura Care Pharmaceuticals, among others. Simultaneously, the Roche-Cipla legal tussle went into trials and in 2012, the Delhi High Court held that Cipla\'s generic version of Roche\'s patented product did not infringe Roche\'s Indian Patent 196774 and Roche was denied a permanent injunction. Roche then appealed against it before the division bench in Delhi High Court.']"

""The momentum of 1972 to 1995 (pre-patent era) can\'t stop . It will last till 2015, but not after that. So to protect myself for 2020 I have to make radical changes.""On Monday, the world got a glimpse of the kind of change that Hamied had in mind when Cipla teamed up with California-based Gilead Lifesciences to make and sell its path-breaking Hepatitis C drug Sofosbuvir under voluntary licence.On the face of it, there is nothing wrong with this kind of a deal. Pharma companies ink many such pacts on a regular basis. But what has stunned the pharma industry is that Cipla and Gilead were once bitter rivals with the American pharmaceutical giant representing everything that Cipla opposed.""It is disappointing but the policy framework under which Cipla used to operate has changed,"" said Leena Menghaney, an intellectual property (IP) expert and lawyer with Medicines Sans Frontier, an aid organisation. ""Also for generic companies who want to challenge patents, the scenario has become a lot difficult.""Cipla did not respond to the email query sent by ET. YK Hamied refused to comment, and Subhanu Saxena, CEO Cipla did not respond to a text message sent by ET.When Hamied cut HIV drug prices to take on multinationals he created a revolution in the global pharma industry. Anti-HIV drugs by multinationals were being sold in many countries at exorbitant prices. Cipla, sensing a big opportunity to establish itself and unseat the hated multinationals, started selling its drugs at $350 per patient per annum. The MNCs, whose drugs were priced $10,000-$15,000 per patient, had no choice but to cut and cut big.That was not all. Hamied\'s long history of attacking multinational drug pricing both verbally and in the form of Cipla\'s generics, and his passionate defence of India\'s patent laws made him unpopular among global drug makers. Some even accused him of being a thief.Battlefield AfricaThis was the time when AIDS was assuming epidemic-like proportions in Africa and western drug firms and countries were universally upbraided for doing too little and too late.Many companies, Indian and foreign, were still grappling with the power of the NGOs, not knowing what to make of it.Some successfully avoided getting caught in battles but many were not so lucky. Cipla went one step ahead of its rivals by co-opting the activists and the health workers earning a David-like status for taking on the multinational Goliaths.That reputation may now be at stake with this Gilead deal. Not only has the pharma major broken ranks and teamed up with multinationals, it has also forsaken its desire not to get sucked into doing the kind of deals like voluntary licencing.In an interview to the popular pharma blog Apothcurry in February last year Hamied had said this: ""Here is a licence for this drug for five years, we will supply you raw material, we will do this we will do that, this is only valid for India, it is not valid here, it\'s not valid there.Then they say you have to sell it under our brand name and that belongs to us.

The major impact has come in the form of Ciprofloxacin 500 and 250 milligram which is 65 per cent of the market of the released ceiling price,"" said Hari Natarajan, vice president, Aiocd Awacs.While Ranbaxy would take a Rs 55-crore hit, Cipla would face a loss of about Rs 46 crore, as a result of the new price cuts announced by the NPPA. Cadila Healthcare, Pfizer, Lupin, Torrent are some of the other companies, drugs of which will get covered by the new price cuts.In July, the NPPA invoked a clause in the drug pricing order to cite extraordinary circumstances for more than 100 diabetes and heart disease drugs, which lie outside the scope of National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) and fixed their price caps in \'public interest\'.The NLEM includes 652 formulations as essential. The drug pricing regulator invoked a special provision under the drug price control that gives it the right to fix the prices of any drug ""in extraordinary circumstances, if it considers necessary to do so in public interest"".It cites huge inter-brand price differences in these drug categories as \'extraordinary\'. The drug companies - both domestic and MNCs - are up in arms against the pricing regulator\'s move.Industry bodies representing drug makers have challenged the decision in the high courts of Delhi and Bombay. Before moving the court, the Indian drug makers sought the intervention of Ananth Kumar, Union minister of chemicals and fertilizers, claiming that inter-brand differences cannot qualify as \'extraordinary\' by any stretch.""The inter-brand differences have always existed and were in existence when the NLEM was drawn up. Also, the inter-brand differences would be found in every single formulation which is manufactured by more than one formulator,"" the Indian Pharma Alliance\'s (a grouping of domestic drug makers) letter to minister said, fearing that by that logic every drug which has more than one player will come under price control, negating the purpose of NLEM 2011, and national pharma pricing policy, 2012.An NPPA official countered the argument by saying, ""If a wrong or discrepancy has existed for years and has not been noticed or acted upon, that doesn\'t become right just by virtue of existing for so many years."" ""We are still studying under which para has the NPPA cut the price,"" said DG Shah, secretary general of Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA).""When you implemented a long drawn drug policy, what was the need for new cuts,"" said a top executive of a multinational drug maker who did not wish to be quoted due to the sensitivity of the issue. Price cuts have become global phenomena as countries battling slow growth and high healthcare costs are going after drug makers to cut price.Germany, the first country in Europe in recent years to announce massive price cuts, wants drug makers to publish the list of rebates that they pass on to insurance providers. Similarly, United Kingdom\'s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the body that advises the country\'s drug regulator, has proposed to introduce a ""value-based assessment"" that would look at the burden of disease and wider social benefit while fixing the price of new drugs.']"

At 78, he remains the company\'s chairman while a professional set of managers handles its operations.Hamied came to the global limelight in 2001 when he reduced the prices of HIV drugs to a fraction of those charged by Western manufacturers. He did something similar in 2012 much to the shock of the industry, when Cipla slashed the prices of key cancer drugs by as much as 75%. Multinational drug companies call Hamied a thief for making and selling copies of their drugs, but for millions of patients in developing countries he has been their Robin Hood.""I am surprised...and getting this award from Economic Times is a great thing. I feel humbled, honoured; I accept the award with all humility. I must say that this has come as a surprise,"" he told ET on Tuesday.It is still too early to predict whether the prices of cancer drugs will come crashing down, but Hamied has set the ball rolling. In the fight against AIDS, Hamied\'s efforts in bringing down drug prices have sealed him a place among top anti-HIV health activists.In early 2001, when Hamied decided to offer the treatment for HIV at $350 per year (about Rs 21,650), or less than a dollar a day, he had said that HIV could become a much bigger calamity than a massive earthquake that had just killed thousands in Gujarat. The difference, he had said, was that HIV was a foreseeable calamity and there was a chance to do something about it. Cipla\'s offer forced multinational companies to massively cut their own prices of antiretroviral drugs, from more than $10,000 (about Rs 62,000 at current rates).""The initial reaction was disbelief,"" he recalled in a conversation with ET a few years ago. ""Could an Indian company actually make these drugs? American reporters have told me that it\'s hard to overestimate the benefit this offer has had for India\'s image.""Most histories of the AIDS crisis consider Hamied\'s offer a turning point in the battle to provide affordable antiretroviral treatment. While multinational firms agreed to lower prices, governments reluctant to provide the drugs were no longer able to hide behind the defence of high costs. Yet, Hamied appears to have been lauded abroad more than in India  though some amends were made when he was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 2005.While he has always been a catalyst for a humanitarian cause, he has also been a hard-nosed businessman who has kept Cipla in the top ranks of India\'s pharmaceutical business. ""Yes we are cutting down the prices, we are being humanitarian, but at the same time we are not doing any charity,"" he had told ET in 2012 when he had cut the prices of the cancer drugs. The one-time poster boy of an anti-MNC wave has been busy doing his own globalising, with a large team in Cipla now busy registering its drugs for sale in 105 countries, from Algeria to Zimbabwe.']"

The domestic drugmaker asked the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion to cancel the patents on the ground that the Swiss company has held them for six years without making the medicine locally or importing it in the quantity that\'s required.It alleged that Novartis imports only about 54,000 units annually, depriving 99.9% of the 1.5 crore people in India who need the drug. ""Novartis\' products do not satisfy even 4,500 patients an nually and our feedback shows the product is urgently needed by the doctor and patient community,"" said a Cipla spokesperson. An email sent to a Novartis India spokesperson went unanswered.Cipla\'s move is likely to open a new front in the ever-expanding conflict between Indian drugmakers and multinationals that goes back several decades. It\'s also likely to become a test case for similar instances. ""This case will open Pandora\'s box. The government will be forced to take notice of all such cases where MNCs are holding on to patents but not launching or selling very little of their patented products. The government will have to take a stand on how it should monitor the situation,"" said the patent head of another top generic firm who didn\'t want to be named.A senior executive at a multinational drugmaker said a company can\'t be forced to sell its products in any market. ""It\'s a decision based on many factors, including commercial reasons,"" he said. Foreign innovator or original research companies believe that Indian drugmakers take advantage of the country\'s weak patent laws to launch cheaper version of their drugs, depriving them of legitimate profits.Indian drug companies say they function within the law and by manufacturing cheaper versions they keep drug prices and healthcare costs low not just in the country but in other parts of the world as well. The government contends that India\'s patent laws comply with international requirements and have been designed to meet the objectives of availability, accessibility and affordability.Many of these disputes end up in court and industry experts expect Novartis to legally challenge the launch of Cipla\'s generic version. Some of the high-profile innovator-generic patent battles currently going on in Indian courts include Cipla versus Swiss drugmaker Hoffman La Roche over lung cancer drug Tarceva (erlotinib); Natco Pharma vs American firm Bristol-Myer Squibb over cancer drug Sprycel (dasatinib); Glenmark and five other generic drugmakers vs US firm Merck Sharp & Dohme over diabetes drug Januvia (sitagliptin).Cipla has launched its indacaterol generic, a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) drug, under the Unibrez brand in some parts of the country. An industry executive said the medicine was priced at about Rs 130 per pack of 10 pills, compared with Onbrez, which sells for Rs 677. A Cipla spokesperson confirmed the launch and said ""Novartis\' product is over 400% more expensive than Cipla\'s product"". Interestingly, Cipla\'s chief executive Subhanu Saxena joined the company from Novartis, where he led its global product strategy and commercialisation functions.In its appeal to DIPP last week, the Indian drugmaker demanded that Novartis\' patents on the drug be revoked under Section 66 of Indian Patents Act. This allows the government to strike down a patent if it concludes that it has been exercised in a manner that doesn\'t benefit the state or public. Cipla argued that by not manufacturing the drug locally and importing only limited quantities through Indian licensee Lupin, Novartis was making""mischievous use of its patent rights"", which is ""detrimental to public"" interest.']"

In an interview with ET, he also spoke about his succession plan for Cipla and the company's broader strategy. Edited excerpts:What is Cipla doing in the biosimilars space?I think we've to be in that. We've had negative experiences. Unfortunately, I myself can't understand the subject. The point is it is very easy to say I want a drug which is biosimilar to so and so. Where do you get the cell line? How do you test an anti-cancer drug? Double-blind tests cost millions (of dollars). It is a different ball game, so we are partnering. I am now a great believer in partnering. I have already marketed one biotech product from China  we are just marketing a new product in stem cells.Will you become a price warrior in biotech?Yes, of course  a dollar a day. Biotech  a dollar a day. You wait and see.Is that a challenge?Yes, that's challenging. And I'm not joking. I don't like the word biosimilar. It should be bio-efficacy. In a biosimilar, you can never make it identical. In China, they don't allow biosimilars. They are saying every drug you have, you use it as a new chemical entity.How is the next generation shaping up?Luckily for us, two members of the family are very much involved in the day-to-day running of the company. They are not only bright, their thinking is like my thinking  very national minded, what is best in India's interest. We have now set up a professional management team... thanks to Samina (Vaziralli) and Kamil (Hamied). We've got a very good team of board members  Adil Zainulbhai, Ashok Sinha, Punita Lal, Nachiket Mor. I've not said publicly so far, but I'll like to see in a year or two Kamil and Samina on Cipla board  I'm grooming them. They are the future of the company, at least from the promoters' side.How do you visualise Cipla in five or 10 years?We've taken a line up to 2024. We are making some plans. We've divided the world into various quarters. I think by 2020, we are hoping that Africa would give us a total business of a billion dollars, we would love to see a billion in America, we would love to see, either directly or through acquisitions, a billion in Europe, a billion in India and a billion in the rest of the world. So there would be a target for 2024 of $5 billion. So you must understand, volume against value. The other day I said if you calculate volume and then calculate it at American prices, we would be four times the size of Pfizer. I'm giving it at $100 and they are giving at $24,000  come on!How do you compare Indian patent laws to those in the US?Our laws are stricter than America's only for one reason and that is the section the Americans don't want India to have  Section 3D, which was introduced within TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights). It stopped ever greening. Americans like frivolous patenting and each is regarded an NCE (new chemical entity), a new salt, a new ester. Patent laws are national laws, not international laws. Every country's patent laws are need-based to that country. That's what I am trying to fight, and nobody is listening.""]"

Excerpts:ET Now: What is your view on the government policies for the pharma sector?YK Hamied:You need a healthy India. None should be denied medication and for this, the government policies have to be such that you can achieve this. Now one of the ways it is possible was a pragmatic licensing policy whereby all the world's latest drugs we could produce here and pay a royalty to the originator. I am a scientist and this science has to be suitably rewarded. There is no doubt about it, but not under monopoly. I am also willing to pay a royalty to the patent holder or the inventor of a drug. Now if you look at the world's top 70 drugs, 50% of them or more are made and marketed by companies that did not invent them.ET Now: In the past few months, there was quite a frosty relationship between the government and pharma companies, especially MNCs, when it came to the pricing regime. What do you think should be the government's immediate priority to create a more stable pricing environment?YK Hamied:Pricing has a lot to do with monopoly. The more the monopoly, the higher is the pricing. If you have free competition, that is the only way to bring down prices. No exclusivity, free competition and prices automatically will come down. I have always said water finds its own level. So that applies to pricing as well.ET Now: The pharma sector has witnessed a great deal of consolidation in the past few months. We have seen a lot of big ticket deals being announced. Do you expect greater consolidation and more M&A; activities in the pharma sector?YK Hamied:Yes, abroad and locally as well, but what we actually require is pragmatic policies. You need some continuity, at least a 5-10 year policy. Like you have a government for five years, your policies should also run for five-year periods. That is all we are saying, but there will be more mergers and acquisitions both in India and abroad and now that Indian companies are getting stronger, they are also looking outside India to expand their activities.ET Now: The budget is around the corner. Pharma is a sector which has in the past been largely ignored as far as the government is concerned in the budget. What kind of sops or concessions do you expect in the government for the pharma sector?YK Hamied:The American government last year spent $31 billion on pharma research and this is where they spent money on fundamental research. It will be an object lesson for the Indian government to study how they do it and why they do it and how there can be better cooperation between the government, science laboratories and the industry.ET Now: How is Cipla poised in the quarters to come? You are stepping down right now, but where do you see the major growth drivers? Respiratory systems is a segment wherein the market expects Cipla to get most of its profits from.YK Hamied:Cipla has been strong in respiratory. Cipla has been strong in the AIDS medication. Cipla has been strong in antimalarial drugs. We are big suppliers in the world. Cipla is strong in cancer. In fact, we as a company have got a very wide circle of therapies. In fact, I would say that we are among the biggest range of products.ET Now: Which segment looks more promising?

Excerpts:ET Now: What is your view on the government policies for the pharma sector?YK Hamied:You need a healthy India. None should be denied medication and for this, the government policies have to be such that you can achieve this. Now one of the ways it is possible was a pragmatic licensing policy whereby all the world's latest drugs we could produce here and pay a royalty to the originator. I am a scientist and this science has to be suitably rewarded. There is no doubt about it, but not under monopoly. I am also willing to pay a royalty to the patent holder or the inventor of a drug. Now if you look at the world's top 70 drugs, 50% of them or more are made and marketed by companies that did not invent them.ET Now: In the past few months, there was quite a frosty relationship between the government and pharma companies, especially MNCs, when it came to the pricing regime. What do you think should be the government's immediate priority to create a more stable pricing environment?YK Hamied:Pricing has a lot to do with monopoly. The more the monopoly, the higher is the pricing. If you have free competition, that is the only way to bring down prices. No exclusivity, free competition and prices automatically will come down. I have always said water finds its own level. So that applies to pricing as well.ET Now: The pharma sector has witnessed a great deal of consolidation in the past few months. We have seen a lot of big ticket deals being announced. Do you expect greater consolidation and more M&A; activities in the pharma sector?YK Hamied:Yes, abroad and locally as well, but what we actually require is pragmatic policies. You need some continuity, at least a 5-10 year policy. Like you have a government for five years, your policies should also run for five-year periods. That is all we are saying, but there will be more mergers and acquisitions both in India and abroad and now that Indian companies are getting stronger, they are also looking outside India to expand their activities.ET Now: The budget is around the corner. Pharma is a sector which has in the past been largely ignored as far as the government is concerned in the budget. What kind of sops or concessions do you expect in the government for the pharma sector?YK Hamied:The American government last year spent $31 billion on pharma research and this is where they spent money on fundamental research. It will be an object lesson for the Indian government to study how they do it and why they do it and how there can be better cooperation between the government, science laboratories and the industry.ET Now: How is Cipla poised in the quarters to come? You are stepping down right now, but where do you see the major growth drivers? Respiratory systems is a segment wherein the market expects Cipla to get most of its profits from.YK Hamied:Cipla has been strong in respiratory. Cipla has been strong in the AIDS medication. Cipla has been strong in antimalarial drugs. We are big suppliers in the world. Cipla is strong in cancer. In fact, we as a company have got a very wide circle of therapies. In fact, I would say that we are among the biggest range of products.ET Now: Which segment looks more promising?

In any case, the government has resorted to the use of section 66 only on two occasions  once in 1994 and a second time in 2012  as the provision is meant to be used if a patent is ""mischievous to the State or generally prejudicial to the public"".Cipla had approached the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) a few months ago arguing that the patents should be revoked as Novartis imported small quantities of the medicine, estimated at around 54,000 units, allegedly depriving 1.5 crore patients who need the drug.The move by the Indian generics firm was the latest demand before the government to use flexibilities available in the Patents Act to issue a compulsory licence, which effectively waives the patent rights and allows a local player to manufacture the medicine and share a part of the revenue as royalty to the patent holder.So far, compulsory licence has been issued only once in 2012, whenNatcowas allowed to manufacture acancerdrug whose patent was held byBayer. Sources said in the case of Cipla\'s request, the health ministry has said if at all there is an argument for a compulsory licence, it should be considered under section 84.

Renotify on February 5,"" the bench said.It also questioned Novartis as to how much quantity of the drug does it import in the country and why a royalty arrangement cannot be worked out.It raised the query after senior advocates P Chidambaram and Pratibha M Singh, who appeared for Cipla, argued how Novartis could claim to working its patent when it was not manufacturing its drug Indaflo in India and was importing it in limited quantities, which too is not completely sold.They opposed the restraint on Cipla, saying where the interests of public at large are involved, an injunction ought not to have been granted.Chidambaram also suggested that Cipla was willing to pay royalty to Novartis for making the drug and would abide by any order of the court in this regard.He contended that the Novartis\' drug was five times costlier than that of Cipla and was not available in majority of the medical stores in the national capital or other cities.Senior advocate C A Sundaram, who appeared for Novartis, opposed the contentions and said that Cipla initially sold its product by copying the Swiss firm\'s trademark.He said that Cipla had also admitted to infringing the patent of Novartis.In response to the contention that Novartis imported limited quantities of its drug, Sundaram said Cipla which started selling the medicine in October 2014 was yet to finish selling its stock, which was permitted by the High Court while restraining the Indian company from further production till it obtained a compulsory licence.Cipla has challenged the high court\'s single judge order of January 9, passed on a plea of the Swiss firm Novartis AG that holds a patent for the Indacaterol maleate salt as well as the manufacturing process for the drug.Novartis in its interim application had sought to restrain Cipla from selling its product during pendency of the patent infringement suit filed by the Swiss pharma firm.The court in its interim order had restrained Cipla from manufacturing its drug sold under the name of \'Indaflo\', but allowed it to sell the stock remaining with it.It had said the restraint on Cipla would remain till its application for compulsory licence was decided by the relevant authority.It had asked Cipla to apply for the licence within two weeks of the order, if not already done so, and had directed the relevant authority to decide the same within six months of receiving the application.Novartis has been selling the medicine in India as an inhalation powder and inhaler under the trademark name of ""Onbrez"" through its licencee Lupin Ltd, since 2010.']"

Of course, the stimulus does put a lot of liquidity in the market, but the direct benefit. Note that the stimulus by the ECB is different from the QE3 of the US market.The US Fed had a different reason and a different pattern.They actually pay 25 bps on the bonds that banks held. That is one of the reason banks kept on hoarding those bonds, and the prices went up.On the flip side, in the European case, there is a negative 75 bps cost if you hold on to bonds. This means that banks they will have to release bonds and actually start absorbing that money.The money will be deployed in the businesses. My sense is that Europe is going to turnaround much faster than anticipations. From that perspective, any company which is in Europe whether it is an IT company or a pharma company will benefit much more.

""They are the future of the company, at least from the promoters\' side. They are not only bright, their thinking is like my thinking  very national minded, what is best in India\'s interest.""A Cipla spokesperson said the younger Hamied was leaving to pursue his own interests and sought to downplay the suggestion that there might have been disaffection on his part, making the point that he had backed the move to bring in professional managers to run the drug maker. Cipla has been going through a spell of turmoil of late, with several changes at the top. ""Kamil has moved out and this month will be his last in the company,"" the person said.""From the leadership point of view, this is not a big thing, as he was involved driving a lot of professionalism himself. He might come back in three or five years\' time, we never know.""Hamied was chief strategy officer cer and managed European operations before Frank Peters was hired to take charge of the region. There has been talk about Hamied having an uncomfortable working relationship withSubhanu Saxena, who was appointed chief executive officer in 2012. The spokesperson refuted this. ""He is grown up and wants to get a new experience outside the company. And the intent of the company is to be professionally run,"" the person said.To be sure, many family run Indian firms are increasingly professionalising by hiring CEOs and other top managers with global experience and proven ability. Hamid\'s exit also raises questions about his induction on board, where he was expected to get an elevated role that would have taken him a step closer to the top.Cipla has seen a top management reshuffle coupled with uncertainty over the business since the team led by Saxena took charge. Saxena is considered one of the highest paid CEOs in India, with a remuneration of Rs 21 crore according to 2013-14 annual report, and was hired with the intention of globalising the business and going into markets where Cipla had not ventured before. However, the ride has been anything but smooth and Saxena has had to face investors\' queries over consistently low growth amid the changes at the top.Peters, who was hired to head Europe, was reassigned to take charge of the global respiratory business. Timothy Crew, hired to run the US unit, was then given additional charge of Europe.The resignation of Sameer Goel as India head within a year of joining has added to the speculation about the company\'s growth path. In April, CLSA downgraded Cipla over lack of clarity on the launch of the company\'s much-awaited dry powder inhaler (DPI) launch. Saxena cancelled an interview request from ET because of his travel schedule.However, the Cipla spokesperson said that the restructuring should be seen in the context of the company\'s focus on key product segments such as respiratory ailments. The company should be able to launch the DPI in six or eight months, the person said. Cipla\'s shares closed at Rs 630.20, up 2.7%, on the BSE Tuesday.']"

The family arrangement proposes that CiplachairmanYK Hamied will supervise the voting methodology in his lifetime and younger brother MK will supervise the same in case of YK\'s infirmity or death.The proposed arrangement, seen as a means to unify the family in taking decisions concerning ownership or sale of shares, is likely to ensure stability of ownership. The Hamied family together owns 36.8% stake in Cipla, with chairmanYusuf Hamiedholding about 14.8% stake in the company. About 23 entities, including the Hamied family, own stakes in the pharma firm. ""We were advised by our legal advisers to seek the market regulator\'s opinion,"" Yusuf Hamied told ET over phone.""It is a professional and legal thing to do,"" said Ramesh K Vaidyanathan, founder and managing partner of Mumbai-based law firmAdvaya Legal. He felt that such arrangements help in avoiding succession battles later and assure the shareholders of the stability of the management. There have been occasional buzz about Cipla changing hands, which has so far been proved wrong.According to the proposed family agreement, the promoter family will exercise its voting power to ensure that it votes as a single unit. In order to ensure that the controlling stake remains with the family, Cipla\'s family agreement suggests pre-emptive rights in case of transfer of share by any family member.The proposed draft has also defined that after the lifetime of YK and MK Hamied, the family member with most votes will supervise joint voting of promoters.Hamied, in his interaction with ET, indicated that Sebi\'s opinion was sought about four months ago, but the regulator has responded only now. When asked whether it was part of the succession plan, Hamied said: ""This is our plan, but nothing has been decided yet. The promoters will now discuss and finalise it. We were waiting for Sebi\'s opinion in this matter.""ET in November last had interviewed Hamied where he expressed his desire to see his nieceSamina Vaziralliand nephewKamil Hamiedon the Cipla board by the new financial year. The Cipla board will meet on May 29. Hamied says the plan to induct his nephew and niece is still ""fluid.""

The family arrangement proposes that CiplachairmanYK Hamied will supervise the voting methodology in his lifetime and younger brother MK will supervise the same in case of YK\'s infirmity or death.The proposed arrangement, seen as a means to unify the family in taking decisions concerning ownership or sale of shares, is likely to ensure stability of ownership. The Hamied family together owns 36.8% stake in Cipla, with chairmanYusuf Hamiedholding about 14.8% stake in the company. About 23 entities, including the Hamied family, own stakes in the pharma firm. ""We were advised by our legal advisers to seek the market regulator\'s opinion,"" Yusuf Hamied told ET over phone.""It is a professional and legal thing to do,"" said Ramesh K Vaidyanathan, founder and managing partner of Mumbai-based law firmAdvaya Legal. He felt that such arrangements help in avoiding succession battles later and assure the shareholders of the stability of the management. There have been occasional buzz about Cipla changing hands, which has so far been proved wrong.According to the proposed family agreement, the promoter family will exercise its voting power to ensure that it votes as a single unit. In order to ensure that the controlling stake remains with the family, Cipla\'s family agreement suggests pre-emptive rights in case of transfer of share by any family member.The proposed draft has also defined that after the lifetime of YK and MK Hamied, the family member with most votes will supervise joint voting of promoters.Hamied, in his interaction with ET, indicated that Sebi\'s opinion was sought about four months ago, but the regulator has responded only now. When asked whether it was part of the succession plan, Hamied said: ""This is our plan, but nothing has been decided yet. The promoters will now discuss and finalise it. We were waiting for Sebi\'s opinion in this matter.""ET in November last had interviewed Hamied where he expressed his desire to see his nieceSamina Vaziralliand nephewKamil Hamiedon the Cipla board by the new financial year. The Cipla board will meet on May 29. Hamied says the plan to induct his nephew and niece is still ""fluid.""

A few months ago,Ciplafounder YK Hamied had referred to nephew Kamil (33) and the latters sister Samina Vaziralli (38) as family members who would carry on the family tradition.Ive not said publicly so far, but Ill like to see in a year or two Kamil and Samina on the Cipla board  Im grooming them, Hamied had said in an interview to ET in November 2014. They are the future of the company, at least from the promoters side. They are not only bright, their thinking is like my thinking  very national minded, what is best in Indias interest.A Cipla spokesperson said the younger Hamied was leaving to pursue his own interests and sought to downplay the suggestion that there might have been disaffection on his part, making the point that he had backed the move to bring in professional managers to run the drug maker. Cipla has been going through a spell of turmoil of late, with several changes at the top. Kamil has moved out and this month will be his last in the company, the person said.From the leadership point of view, this is not a big thing, as he was involved driving a lot of professionalism himself. He might come back in three or five years time, we never know.Hamied was chief strategy officer cer and managed European operations before Frank Peters was hired to take charge of the region. There has been talk about Hamied having an uncomfortable working relationship withSubhanu Saxena, who was appointed chief executive officer in 2012. The spokesperson refuted this. He is grown up and wants to get a new experience outside the company. And the intent of the company is to be professionally run, the person said.To be sure, many family run Indian firms are increasingly professionalising by hiring CEOs and other top managers with global experience and proven ability. Hamids exit also raises questions about his induction on board, where he was expected to get an elevated role that would have taken him a step closer to the top.Cipla has seen a top management reshuffle coupled with uncertainty over the business since the team led by Saxena took charge. Saxena is considered one of the highest paid CEOs in India, with a remuneration of Rs 21 crore according to 2013-14 annual report, and was hired with the intention of globalising the business and going into markets where Cipla had not ventured before. However, the ride has been anything but smooth and Saxena has had to face investors queries over consistently low growth amid the changes at the top.Peters, who was hired to head Europe, was reassigned to take charge of the global respiratory business. Timothy Crew, hired to run the US unit, was then given additional charge of Europe.The resignation of Sameer Goel as India head within a year of joining has added to the speculation about the companys growth path. In April, CLSA downgraded Cipla over lack of clarity on the launch of the companys much-awaited dry powder inhaler (DPI) launch. Saxena cancelled an interview request from ET because of his travel schedule.However, the Cipla spokesperson said that the restructuring should be seen in the context of the companys focus on key product segments such as respiratory ailments. The company should be able to launch the DPI in six or eight months, the person said. Ciplas shares closed at Rs 630.20, up 2.7%, on the BSE Tuesday.']"

They also expect margins to improve on a y-o-y basis.After a long wait, Cipla now has an opportunity in respiratory inhalers post the launch of gSeretide in certain markets in the EU, and gXopenex and gPulmicort in the US, highlights HSBC.Although very successful in respiratory in India, HSBC believes that this first wave of inhaler launches will give confidence in its capability to penetrate asthma/COPD in regulated markets as well.The GEMs Super 15 is an equally-weighted portfolio of 15 stocks with the principal objective of reflecting the convictions of both strategists and our stock analysts, HSBC said.As of 17 August 2015, the portfolio has outperformed the custom MSCI EM benchmark by 44.0% since launch on 4 February 2013 (benchmark is comprised of equally weighting the index returns of the MSCI EM EMEA, MSCI EM ASIA and MSCI EMLatin Americaindices), HSBC said.']"

As of now, it is not a game changer but it can be as the product scales up over a period of years. So, it is good news and the ANDA approval that they have got is also of decent size product, so it will add to the company but since the company is so big that such small approvals do not add significantly.']"

Should investors look at buying the dips which the market is going to give us right now? Do you think it is a bottom less pit? Should we wait and watch when the poison gets out of the system and then jump in?Parag Thakkar: Since the last 15-20 days, we have been very cautious. Commodities prices have been falling and continue to fall. From last six times, China PMI is coming at below 50. It was at a 77-month low the last time. So things are not that great because China is a $11 trillion economy with a very high debt toGDP, highly levered towards commodities and properties.The issue is that both of these are going through structural downturn. But, in my view, we will see extended correction which might offer interesting buying opportunities in some of the secular sectors. In India, for example, no matter what happens road construction seems to be the theme for next five years. This is a great time to buy these kind ofstockssince they are midcaps and will be available very cheap if this correction continues. Others include good IT companies like MindTree which are seeing a good dollar revenue growth.Also selected pharma companies which have a very good EPS,CAGR. I would like to extend this to some of the commodity stocks also which are totally under leveraged. The cash is as good as 45-50 per cent of market cap. Those can become very cheap and offer very interesting buying opportunities this week.ET Now: Will you be a buyer right now at 8037? What will you buy right now?Parag Thakkar: BasicallyInfosysand MindTree are our top picks in the IT space. In road construction there are so many midcaps but I would stick to a very under leveraged name, like KNR Construction. These are the two clear opportunities. In pharma, there are some companies where EPS, CAGR looks very good-- for example, Cadila or Sun Pharma. These are some of the stocks which I would like to be bullish on.Also a company likeTitanwhich has actually given improved outlook from Q3 onwards. Since gold has found a bottom and rupee at 66 improves outlook for gold. So Titan is one of the company which definitely will be under our radar.']"

Excerpts:ET Now: What is your take on Cipla's $500-million acquisition of Hetero Drugs?Praful Bohra:From a strategic perspective, this acquisition will definitely speed up and streamline Cipla's US entry. Cipla's portfolio is largely of acommodity genericstype; so this will definitely place the company in a strong position in terms of product pipeline in the US market.So, this will bolster Cipla's US operations in the next 2-3 years.ET Now: What are the key products of Hetero? What is the current geographical profile of Hetero drugs?Praful Bohra:I do not have the geographical profile. But they have some blockbuster products such as acyclovir, amlodipine, escitalopram, etc. Then they haveAripiprazolewhich is anAbilify. It is a very interesting product.ET Now: What is your take on the valuation of this buy? At about 2.5-3 times, do you think it is attractive? More importantly, does Ciplas balance sheet have that kind of strength?Praful Bohra:The valuation is pretty reasonable considering the fact that some recent deals have happened at much higher valuations. For example, look at Lupins acquisition of Gavis.Cipla has cash balance of roughly around Rs 500-odd crore. The rest would be managed by way of debt. They are in a pretty strong position in terms of leverage. Cipla can definitely leverage its balance sheet. I do not think the financing of this deal would be any issue at all.ET Now: The Medpro acquisition has not worked wonders for Cipla so far. In an industry that sees more failures than successes, is Cipla trying to bite off more than it can chew?Praful Bohra:It would be wrong to generalise. The markets are different  one is South Africa, the other is the US. Medpro was a familiar business for Cipla, whereas the US would be a new market for them altogether.Let's just wait and see how things play out going forward.ET Now: What is your call on the stock at the moment?Praful Bohra:We have a hold rating on the stock with a target of 755.ET Now: Cipla has been criticised in the past for losing market share and its below-industry growth average and margins. Now, will this acquisition meaningfully change the earnings trajectory for Cipla in the next 3-4 quarters?Praful Bohra:Earnings-wise Cipla is pretty well placed even now. They are growing at one of the fastest paces in the industry as of now. The only issue is that Cipla had been in an investment mode till now; whatever expectations people had of them were not turning fruitful.For the next one to one-and-a-half years, Cipla will perhaps still be in an investment mode. But earnings-wise, they are still pretty well placed. They have not grown very well in the past couple of years; so on that base, they should continue to do well.""]"

Lupin recently bought Gavis Pharma in the US for about $880 million, while Sun Pharma has a strong presence through Taro and Caraco. A proposal to purchase Kremers Urban, the generic drug business of Belgian drugmaker UCB, fell through last month after rival Lanett stepped in to acquire it. ET was first to report on Ciplas acquisition plan on Friday.The purchase of InvaGen and Exelan will give Cipla access to a large network of distributors, the government and institutional market, manufacturing facility and an R&D; base. Cipla will also secure a portfolio of drugs and filings covering a wide range of illnesses like HIV and diabetes. A pipeline of drugs, so important to drug industry investors focused on future blockbuster drugs, will help Cipla plan its growth in a market estimated to touch $80 billion by 2018. The team is serious about the US, said Cipla chairman YK Hamied.It is a team decision and with price pressure in India, the US is the way forward for us. People closely associated with the deal mentioned that the negotiations with Hetero was on since December last year and it took a while convincing the board to agree for a deal of this size.Ciplas managing director Subhanu Saxena said that the purchase is in line with the strategy to grow Ciplas market share. We see Inva-Gen as a strong strategic fit with a relevant diverse portfolio as well as a strong market and customer presence, Saxena said. Ironically during Ciplas annual general meeting last week, Saxena had downplayed the companys M&A; plans in the US and said that they would look at organic route to expand its business.Since the new management team took charge from Hamied two years ago, Cipla has gone on a global expansion drive, having a frontend presence in areas where it had mere distribution presence.

Edited excerpts:How will you leverage the InvaGen deal, considering margins of some of its products are quite low? Distributors in the US have told us that margins are as low as in single digits.With about 32 marketed products, the company has demonstrated revenues of over $200 million in the year ended 2014 and over $225 million in last twelve months, with an overall EBITDA margin of over 25%. With a strong cost position and a balanced portfolio, the margins of the business are strong and growing year-on-year. It recorded a sales growth of 20%CAGRover the last three years. The company is one of the top high volume players in the US pharmaceutical market. The investment also strengthens Ciplas presence in the US in terms of scale, revenue manufacturing opportunities and building a wide-ranging product portfolio. The transaction is expected to be EPS accretive to Cipla from the first year of the acquisition.Going forward what will be your plan for the US market?We have had a good beginning in the US since our go live in January 2015 and we expect to continue our growth trajectory there. With the success of our genericNexiumlaunch with our partner Teva, we have created a very positive sentiment among stakeholders in the US. Our strategy for the US is to successfully deliver on our complex generics and respiratory pipeline. We are open to looking at both organic and inorganic growth opportunities that contribute to value creation. By 2020, our goal is that the US will contribute about 20% to our overall business.Which new areas of growth would you like Cipla to venture into?We have a lot of room to grow in our core geography and therapy areas. Cipla is an early mover in emerging markets, with an established presence to capture opportunities and growth in these markets. About 68% of our overall business is contributed by emerging markets such as India and Africa. The key drivers for Ciplas growth here are the rapid economic growth of these markets resulting in rising disposable income as well as increased healthcare infrastructure and spending.Africawill continue to remain a key element of our growth strategy.With yourFMCGbackground, how do you see your experience with PepsiCo helping you drive the changes at Cipla?I have found my experience at PepsiCo both in Australia and in the US very valuable in terms of understanding how a nimble, entrepreneurial environment can exist within a large organisation.

Novartis, subject to conclusion of discussions, may agree to give distribution rights for the product to Cipla, much on the lines of its existing terms with Lupin, he said.

An industry source said the dispute could be related to some manufacturing contracts, but this could not be verified. PuraCap has a presence in branded and private labeldrugs, in addition to over-the-counter and prescription products.Although strong in markets like India andAfrica, Cipla lags its leading local peers in terms ofmarket sharein the US. The deal is aimed at boosting its presence in the US, from where it targets to generate at least 20% of overall revenue by 2020.The two companies  InvaGen and Exelan  are expected to bring scale to Cipla via access to a wide-ranging product portfolio, including cardiovascular, anti-infective, CNS, anti-diabetic and anti-depression drugs that had combined annual revenue of about $225 million. At the time of the announcement of the deal, Cipla said it had access to about 40 applications for new generic drugs, 32 marketed products and 30 pipeline products that were expected to be approved over four years.

We grew 25% in this quarter and year to day growth of 30%.In addition to the impact of esomeprazole, there is still very strong underlying organic growth for the business. We expect the bulk of the esomeprazole sales now have been clocked in the first half of the year but the good news is the organic growth for the business is continuing and will continue for the rest of the year.ET Now: Yes, but can I get some numbers from you, the numbers of the Nexium generic in Q2?Subhanu Saxena:We do not breakout the numbers, but what I can say is if you look at the organic growth of the business starting from Q4 last year as an indication, you can expect that the organic business continues to grow roughly that rate.ET Now: What has gone wrong with the domestic markets though this time, because the growth is just sub-1% when the street was anticipating a double digit number?Subhanu Saxena:Actually I have to split the numbers into our branded business and our generics business. Our branded Rx business did grow in line with market, and as I had mentioned in the last call, we restructured our generics portfolio last year. So you are seeing year on year declines in our generics business driven mainly by portfolio restructuring, so our branded Rx business actually showing very good healthy growth in line with market and we expect that growth to accelerate.ET Now: You, at the end of Q1 said that the guidance will be 20 per cent in the top line. Now are you revising it?Subhanu Saxena:We are still sticking with our guidance for now. Let us see how the next quarter pans out, and then we will revisit. Obviously we have various events happening as we speak. We are looking to close our US acquisitions later this quarter, beginning of next quarter. So we will revisit the guidance as we go through this Q3.ET Now: How will the second half pan out for the company in terms of top line, margins? Will it be slower in the second half as you are not revising the guidance?Subhanu Saxena:As I mentioned, if I look at the impact of esomeprazole, you would not see that in the second half of the year, but you will see good strong organic growth continuing for the balance of the year, we have mentioned amid the high teens as the underlying organic growth rate, we expect that to continue.ET Now: What are the factors that are not going in favour of the company for the UK Advair launch?Subhanu Saxena:We are on track with our overall European regulatory timelines and I had mentioned it is about 12-18 month timeline to go through all those regulatory steps. As of now, we remain on track versus our own expectations. I also mentioned last time that actually Europe is not a major driver of our respiratory growth.We see over a billion dollars of growth in our respiratory business over the next five years, half of that growth is coming and will come from markets where we already exist today. That is in our hands as we speak. If we look at the remaining half of the growth, two-thirds will come from our US business in our pipeline and our pipeline remains on track for the US. Only the balance one-third comes from our European launches.So the bulk of our growth is actually going to come from where we are today, and as we launch our US pipeline and for our European regulatory timelines we remain in line with our expectations.ET Now: How are you talking the InvaGen deal ahead, will the 483s impact this deal?Subhanu Saxena:As you can imagine, we do full due diligence before we enter into any acquisition, and make sure we are aware of all the issues. Of course, Cipla has very strong standards on quality, and we look to bring those to all of our operations. So we remain on track to close the transaction. We are waiting for key US regulatory approvals to happen. As of now, things remain on track. We obviously will need to wait until we have all regulatory approvals in place.""]"

We grew 25% in this quarter and year to day growth of 30%.In addition to the impact of esomeprazole, there is still very strong underlying organic growth for the business. We expect the bulk of the esomeprazole sales now have been clocked in the first half of the year but the good news is the organic growth for the business is continuing and will continue for the rest of the year.ET Now: Yes, but can I get some numbers from you, the numbers of the Nexium generic in Q2?Subhanu Saxena:We do not breakout the numbers, but what I can say is if you look at the organic growth of the business starting from Q4 last year as an indication, you can expect that the organic business continues to grow roughly that rate.ET Now: What has gone wrong with the domestic markets though this time, because the growth is just sub-1% when the street was anticipating a double digit number?Subhanu Saxena:Actually I have to split the numbers into our branded business and our generics business. Our branded Rx business did grow in line with market, and as I had mentioned in the last call, we restructured our generics portfolio last year. So you are seeing year on year declines in our generics business driven mainly by portfolio restructuring, so our branded Rx business actually showing very good healthy growth in line with market and we expect that growth to accelerate.ET Now: You, at the end of Q1 said that the guidance will be 20 per cent in the top line. Now are you revising it?Subhanu Saxena:We are still sticking with our guidance for now. Let us see how the next quarter pans out, and then we will revisit. Obviously we have various events happening as we speak. We are looking to close our US acquisitions later this quarter, beginning of next quarter. So we will revisit the guidance as we go through this Q3.ET Now: How will the second half pan out for the company in terms of top line, margins?

As of now, we remain on track versus our own expectations. I also mentioned last time that actually Europe is not a major driver of our respiratory growth.We see over a billion dollars of growth in our respiratory business over the next five years, half of that growth is coming and will come from markets where we already exist today. That is in our hands as we speak. If we look at the remaining half of the growth, two-thirds will come from our US business in our pipeline and our pipeline remains on track for the US.

The ruling is the second in a month to have upheld patent rights of an overseas drug company and sets akey precedent with regard to intellectual property, experts said.The court, however, rejected Roches plea for an injunction on Ciplas product, considering the patent expires in March 2016. Roche, which was granted a patent for Tarceva in 2007, sued Cipla in 2008 after the Indian company launched cheaper version Erlocip. Cipla said it hadnt infringed the innovators patent as it sold a polymorphic form of the drug.Legal experts noted that Cipla may appeal against the decision of the division bench to the Supreme Court but this could not be confirmed from the company. In its latest order, the court directed Cipla to pay Rs 5 lakh while adding that it will be liable to render accounts concerning the manufacture and sale of Erlocip to record evidence pertaining to the profits made by Cipla concerning the offending product.In a statement to ET, Roche said it welcomed the decision of the court, which has upheld the patent covering erlotinib hydrochloride (Tarceva) and found Cipla to have infringed it.The latest decision sets aside a 2009 verdict by a single judge in the same court that had rejected Roches arguments and allowed the Indian drug firm to continue selling its product.Roche and Cipla then cross appealed against that decision and last year, on directions from court, the two had agreed to discuss a settlement via a mediation exercise. However, an amicable settlement remained elusive and the case moved back to court. In a 106-page order, Justices Pradeep Nandarajog and Mukta Gupta outlined contentions of the two sides. The court was clear about nature of infringement.This (the patent claim) is a sufficiently broad claim that is clearly not limited to any polymorphic version of erlotinib hydrochloride, but to erlotinib hydrochloride itself, it said. This compound may exist in several polymorphic forms, but any and all such forms will be subsumed within this patent. Therefore as Ciplas Erlocip is admittedly one particular polymorphic form of the Erlotinib Hydrochloride compound (Polymorph B), it will clearly infringe IN774 patent.Roche had said its patent covered all polymorphs and derivatives of erlotinib while Cipla contended its product (polymorph B) didnt infringe Roches intellectual property.

The drug in focus is the generic version of Nexium, a heartburn pill, which has earned over $5.5 billion for the owner AstraZeneca so far.Torrent Pharma got an approval to sell the drugs generic version last month. Cipla, too, will benefit since it is supplying ingredients to Teva, another foreign pharma company, which is selling the generic version.Dr Reddys launched Nexiums generic version in September end. The move was immediately challenged by AstraZeneca because Dr Reddys version came in purple, which was starkly similar to the patented drug. This resulted in a temporary restraining order on Dr Reddys Lab.Recent appeal by Dr Reddys has also been turned down last week by the Delaware Federal judge. Some analysts believe that the recent observations at Dr Reddys plants would need a side transfer which could further delay the re-launch of Nexium. A side transfer is manufacturing the drug at some other plant and may need plant approvals by the USFDA. The benefit to other pharma players may not be necessarily in market share gain. The operating margins of such drugs are around 80% and a new entrant can really create price erosion, said Nimish Mehta of Research Delta Advisors, a pharma focussed research firm.According to the US healthcare information provider IMS Health, Nexiums branded and generic sales put together amounted to around $5.2 billion or `35,000 crore in the end of July.']"

Generics sales in the US, launch of inhalers in the UK and a ramp up from its acquisitions are key positive factors to look forward to. Will the company be able to deliver on these promises?Cipla has over a period of time changed its strategy by moving away from a partnership-based model of supplyingdrugsto creating its own marketing front-end in the developed markets of the US and Europe, and building its products pipeline. While the company has guided that the second half of the current fiscal is likely to be weaker than the first half, the growth factors for the coming fiscal appear promising.A guidance of 15% growth in the prescription business in the local market and around 10 new launches in the US over 12-18 months hold promise for the coming fiscal. Launch of combination inhalers in the UK, though delayed, remains a key positive trigger. The company has built a promising pipeline of products for launch in the US, especially in the areas of respiratory, anti-infective and oncology.Invagen, its acquisition in the US, holds pipeline of a clutch of first to file products slated for launch over the next two years. With Invagen acquisition, Cipla has over 100 ANDAs (abbreviated new drug approvals) in the US. The USFDA observations received on its Indore facility has no major ramification on Cipla's near-term performance since the facility has a small contribution to the US sales. Ramp up of its acquisitions and joint ventures is likely to harness the next level of growth for the company. The company has guided for 22% revenue growth for FY16.

The development marks an important step for the company in bolstering its fledgling presence in the US, with an additional revenue of $230 million in FY 2017, company official said.The deal closure, that involved approvals from the US regulatory agencies, will see Cipla vault its sales from that market to around $400 million. It expects to launch as many as 10 products in FY2017. Cipla expects to file 3 to 4 products cumulatively each quarter via its newest acquisition.Speaking to ET, Cipla COO Umang Vohra said going forward the company may exit a few geographies while more attention will be given to certain critical markets like the US.""The idea is to simplify our business and stay focused,"" he noted.

Edited excerptsET Now: What is the likely impact of the acquiring InvaGen Pharma going to be on the overall revenues of Cipla?Umang Vohra:We funded this acquisition through a debt raising in our overseas entity which has bought this company in the US. I am not sure how much it will impact a future cash flow. I think the money that we make out of this entity in terms of cash flow in the future would be enough to give us the payback that we want from this deal.ET Now: How much debt have you taken and how does the debt equity ratio change for Cipla for now?Umang Vohra:So the debt equity ratio would still be shy of 0.5 which is quite a favourable risk profile but it was always our intention to take debt to the max that we could tofinancethis acquisition.ET Now: The big concern that the market had concerned the form 483 that InvaGen got. Tell us what is the update there?Umang Vohra:The form 483 had made observations that we had under diligence and we kept signalling this through without being able to speak of it. The observations were procedural, and we are hopeful of closing out the observations on the InvaGen 483.ET Now: So in the contract, is there any term stating that in case there is a warning letter or an import alter (hypothetically), does this deal still go through or are there provisions that Cipla has in terms of liability for this or doesHeterowill have to pay for it? What exactly are the provisions?Umang Vohra:So there are no provisions specific to this. In most deals, general provisions of good standing for the company, since we were aware of this we have done due diligence very well. We actually think that hopefully the close out from the inspection will happen soon. We have gone through the answers that have been given and we frankly think that the company is in the path of addressing and getting remediate around this, so there are no a) I do not think the observations were material in significant for us to worry about them at all.ET Now: In the press release, you have said that this deal will be EPS accretive. How are you seeing this integration with InvaGen in the US markets?Umang Vohra:EPS accretive because the current business has a fairly favourable EBITDA profile and then on top of that we are selling about 32 products in the US. There are 30 more which are pending to be launched. We should be launching about 10 odd in the next financial year FY17 and as we speak, we are actually trying to launch a product just after closing. So we feel good about just the number of products that will be launched. They are almost equal in number to the ones that are launched and the current revenue profile is $230 million. So it is accretive today. Even if you were to just take today's business accretive for us and with the future launches coming in, we could grow this business in the future.ET Now: So will InvaGen numbers be part of the consolidated fourth quarter numbers for Cipla?Umang Vohra:Yes we will report. InvaGen is part of consolidated numbers and we had always maintained a guidance not including InvaGen for the year. In the next year, we will signal something with both the entities combined.ET Now: So guidance of 20-22 per cent revenue growth and 100 to 150 bps margin improvement does not include InvaGen. You are saying Cipla as a standalone entity with Medpro will be able to do this?Umang Vohra: Yes, we never signalled the guidance with InvaGen at the beginning of FY16. So we are not going to come back and say the guidance had to include this now. We are not going to do that.ET Now: What about the product profile? What products does Cipla have, what does InvaGen have in the next four to five months and as a combined entity how will you tackle the US markets?Umang Vohra: So there is minimal overlap between the Cipla portfolio and the InvaGen portfolio. We think this is a business for us in the US. What we will sell directly and what we will sell through partners could be in the range of about $400 million and that range it is not really big but it is critically sized for us in the US. Our aim is to really grow this significantly so that as Cipla grows, the US business brings in almost 25 per cent of revenues. The US business will have the respiratory franchise and products as well as the HIV products and oncology products. Cipla is well positioned to advantage to compete in these areas.ET Now: Give us more clarity on your partnership with Camber because most of InvaGen's retail sales come in from Camber. Some of these products will come into Cipla. So there is a high chance that there will be price erosion and a loss of market share. How does this deal work with Camber?Umang Vohra: It is a phased transition. A large part of the sale to the customers will move from Camber to our own front end in the US and most of that transition will happen relatively quick. A little bit of it will take a little longer to close out depending on customer needs and not so much on integration. So camber distribution will eventually stop in the US, majority of it moving out within the next month or so. Therefore Cipla by itself will be selling these products in the front end in the US.ET Now: What about the deal with Hetero because InvaGen takes a lot of API from Hetero. They need high tonnage API while Hetero is a low cost producer for API. So how does the dynamics change here? Are you looking at other suppliers or are you going to continue with this partnership?Umang Vohra:By and large, the Hetero API sale to InvaGen should continue and there are some areas where we obviously will go for future products. The choice would be left to InvaGen. Other than InvaGen, Cipla itself has a very deep relationship as well to buy APIs. So it is not just a partnership which is founded with the InvaGen business. Cipla's current business with Hetero is far larger in terms of API than the business between InvaGen and Hetero.""]"

Top Indian drug makers have found that shop-floor employees who are generally callous with basic civic discipline may also be habitually taking shortcuts in their assigned responsibilities. With regulatory pressure growing on them, these companies are now forgetting bitter rivalries to jointly tackle a common concern.It may appear trifling that the day-to-day behavioural issues of workers lead to errors in critical records that are integral to the manufacturing processes for medicines. It aggravates when they try to cover up. Data integrity - a term often used in industry parlance - has surfaced as the single biggest bane for drug companies that are closely watched for quality compliance by the US Food and Drug Administration.The agency\'s concerns for the safety of medicines cannot be understated as every third pill consumed in the US is shipped from an Indian facility. For top drug makers, the US is the biggest market.The consequences of utter disregard to quality - known or accidental - have been precipitous with big names like Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Cadila Healthcare, IPCA Laboratories and Dr Reddy\'s Laboratories pummeled by warning letters and a clamp down on shipping products, or even in seeking out future approvals. Worse still, with no resolution in sight even after prolonged remediation processes, companies have risked a beating to their reputations.The impact is uniting Indian companies. Arch rivals are grouping to look for a lasting solution to what external subject experts call ""deeply ingrained culture issue"". Leading the way are six drug makers -Sun Pharma,Torrent,Cipla, Lupin, Dr Reddy\'s and Cadila - which have formed a \'Quality Forum\' that aims to address the quality challenges.""We do not deny that there is no problem when it comes to manufacturing, however we want to tell the regulators that we are committed to quality,"" said DG Shah, secretary-general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, who is steering the initiatives on behalf of the companies that his lobby group represents. As one of the steps, the group in consultations with McKinsey is putting together a meeting later this month (on February 23) that will see top officials from theUS FDAand UK\'s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency exchange notes with industry players and deliberate on ways to ensure full compliance.""The near-term focus will be on a pragmatic set of quality-related interventions,"" said Shah. For the past one year, he said, these companies are engaged in driving initiatives that include accurate interpretation and adoption of data integrity guidelines, development of right quality metrics to benchmark, diagnose and track improvements in quality performance and building capability and the right quality culture.Experts noted that the US FDA\'s clear message to the industry is to ""do what you say and say what you do"". Shah said the industry is ""bound to abide by this statement"". Among corrective measures, training of staff is on top of the list. Against the past where CEOs and top executives were picked for updates on regulatory compliance, the focus has shifted to the other end - skilling staffers at the factories who directly handle manufacturing systems.""Even a few years ago, 60-70% of the training budget was typically allocated to the leadership teams, now almost all of it goes down to the workers,"" a senior consultant on manufacturing issues said. While in the past, a veteran QC head in said, the US FDA\'s questions were directed to facility heads or senior officials, they now choose to speak to workmen directly who handle data systems and that necessitates thorough knowledge of the operating procedures.Companies are not taking any chances. A few are known to have replaced semi-skilled temporary staff with technically qualified and trained manpower on permanent roles. At one company, at an induction programme two months ago, a batch of young recruits were lectured by external consultants that their conduct outside the factory premise is inseparably tied toquality standardsat the factory site. ""A 15-day programme is now extended to a full month to guarantee that the new staff is familiarized with the company\'s value systems and rigours of the regulatory requirement,"" said the head of quality assurance/control at a Mumbai-based company. Deviations may lead to warnings and grave lapses could result in marching orders, they were cautioned.Hyderabad-based Aurobindo Pharma sends groups of its grassroots employees to evening schools for an intensive course in spoken English. On successful completion, they are rewarded credits that accrue in their annual appraisals.""The idea is to equip workers with the basics of English so that they can respond to questions related to site audits... Since most workers speak in the local dialect, the effort is in preparing our staff in confidently apprising the FDA inspectors with factual technical information and not get nervous when probed,"" an adviser on manufacturing standards said. Aurobindo didn\'t respond to questions.These measures form part of a strategy to regain the confidence of US regulators, say experts. The steps follow the grief that Ranbaxy (now part of Sun Pharma) went through after it was penalized by the US Department of Justice on felony charges in 2013. Four of Ranbaxy\'s sites in India - Paonta Sahib, Dewas, Mohali and Toansa - are blocked from dispatching products to the US.The $120 billion US generic drug market, which produced billionaires among Indian pharma companies, remains the most lucrative with over 85% of prescription volume from generic drugs. Although competition is stiff, with no price control, exclusive marketing opportunities, high margins and a population that is largely reimbursed for healthcare expenses by insurance companies, it continues to be the growth engine for most Indian firms.But those ambitions have faced unprecedented headwinds. From 2008, Indian drug makers have received nearly 50 warning letters, of which more than 20 have resulted in import bans, an ICRA research report in January said. The ratings firm sees these warnings as a big risk for the entire industry, because these could delay product approvals and launches in the US.In the past four months, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy\'s, Cadila and IPCA have been slapped with warnings for violations in manufacturing practices. Among the many deviations, the FDA highlighted shortcomings in the operating procedures, tampering with data linked to test results or sloppy maintenance of factories, like leakages in ceilings.""Your firm failed to establish and follow appropriate written procedures that are designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile, and that include validation of all aseptic and sterilization processes,"" Thomas Cosgrove, director of quality at US FDA, wrote in a warning letter to one of Sun Pharma\'s largest facilities at Halol in Gujarat.A Sun Pharma spokesperson told ET the company takes the situation very seriously. ""Our team is committed to full resolution of all compliance issues in line with US FDA\'s expectations,"" he said. ""We are working with subject matter experts to understand what we missed in our remediation efforts and all cGMP (current good manufacturing practices) corrective enhancements necessary will be undertaken.""In another recent case, the US FDA pointed to lapses at one of Zydus Cadila\'s sites, noting that the firm failed to establish and follow adequate written procedures describing the handling of all written and oral complaints regarding a drug product. At a facility of Dr Reddy\'s, the FDA allegedly found a hidden lab.According to consultants, investigators are strict about disclosures by the companies. They come looking for patterns and when they identify deviations across the board, they raise the red flag, one expert said.""There are some deep-rooted culture-related issues that are holding back companies to tackle quality issues head on,"" said Robert Rhodes, VP for quality and compliance at Quintiles, a US-based consulting firm. ""Employees are overworked and underpaid,"" he said, adding that when it comes to quality, companies have seen it as a cost centre. ""So, willingness to spend proactively for quality or compliance is at times not considered a high priority amongst some drug makers"" he noted.There is also the ingrained behaviour among the staff of not going against the immediate senior. So, even if there is error from seniors, the shop-floor employee is hesitant to correct it fearing a backlash, Rhodes said, running in sharp contrast to international operating guidelines where the employees are encouraged to report every fault that they notice.In a recent report that deals with quality concerns in general, Quintiles pressed on three factors concerning the problems related to data integrity. It pointed out that the leadership may be lax in holding teams accountable to ethical and quality standards, with a lack of appropriate principles, systems, controls and oversight.""Fraud may be tolerated or encouraged,"" the report authored by Maria McDonald and Glen Potvin said. The second is that financial success may be prioritized over product quality, where unrealistic cost controls lead to inadequate investment in staffing, training and development. As the third issue, it blamed ""autocratic leaders"" who are not interested in two-way communications or team engagement, with the result that staff work to ""please the boss"" rather than focussing on doing the right thing.Isabelle Noblanc, vice president at pharmaceutical consulting firm UL EduNeering, said Indian companies have traditionally focused on a ""tick the check box"" approach towards compliance and that has proved to be insufficient.Companies need to take comprehensive cleaning up internally, a senior pharmaceutical executive said. ""You cannot apply a band aid when a surgery is needed just because it costs less. The wound will only fester.""']"

The company, India\'s third-largest drugmaker, plans to deploy more funds for research and development in respiratory, dermatology, neurology and oncology segments and hopes for the first commercial launch in the US around 2020.Scouting for in-licensing opportunities is also part of the plan to jumpstart work, according to the company, which clocked over $2 billion in global sales last year.Cipla\'s move is aimed at closing the gap with fellow drugmakers such asSun Pharma, Dr Reddy\'s andLupin. The drugmaker, which is going through an uneasy transformation process to professional management over the past four years, had partnered leading generic companies such asTevabut remained on the sidelines in the world\'s largest drug market.Last year, it acquired US-based Invagen in a deal worth $550 million. Its total US sales added to about $400 million last year, much lower than that of its Indian peers that entered the generics business early on and scaled up to a critical mass, clocking sales of well over $1billion in the US. But Cipla\'s global chief operating officer Umang Vohra said there is enough scope for the company to leapfrog and leverage its inherent technological capabilities with a thrust on the specialtiy side to narrow the gap with its local peers.""What we don\'t want to happen is to try to catch up on the US generics piece now and then five years later, we again start to catch up on the speciality side of the business. As we begin to catch up on the US generics space, we are also ensuring attention to speciality business,"" said Vohra, who joined the company in September last year after spearheading a range of leadership roles at Dr Reddy\'s for over 14 years.Cipla\'s research budget may spiral up to 8% of sales from 6% at present as it prepares for the new opportunities, he said.Vohra said that the company may revise its forecast of achieving 20% sales from theUS marketby 2020 to about 30% of sales by the end of this decade. He admitted that the company is a late starter in the US and that it could have gained significantly had it taken products such as esomeprazole (where Teva significantly gained sales) or Dymista (for which Meda partnered Cipla and got acquired earlier this year by Mylan for $7.2 billion) on its own.Cipla is now in the process of identifying products that can cater to the future healthcare needs such as long acting injectables or that can help patients with easier dosing options. ""We will not be present in more than two therapies and it will be an incrementally innovative product with a 505(b2) route. It will be a well-known active (substance or ingredient) that is repurposed,"" Vohra said.He said dermatology is another area that Cipla can also explore, like many other companies, as it is easier to have an incremental innovation in this segment. The clinical end-points in some of such drugs are not difficult to achieve, which may be completed with as little spends as $20-30 million, he said. Sun Pharma and Dr Reddy\'s have been aggressively ramping up their innovative drugs pipeline, particularly in dermatology segment, in the US.While US will be the key focus area for Cipla, Vohra is firming up plans to cut exposure to more than 130 emerging markets where the company currently operates. The company may consolidate focus to less than 100 markets. ""If we are to deploy our assets and the best people, we have to make a choice and it is linked to relative returns,"" Vohra said.All of the 30 markets together may not be contributing more than 1% of the total sales, he said. The markets that Cipla may exit include Azerbaijan, East Timor, Curucao and Paraguay.On the much-watched issue of US FDA\'s observation for the firm\'s Indore site, Vohra said he expects to hear from the regulatory agency by May. The company has worked on remediation of all the issues that were pointed out as part of the inspections last year, he said.']"

Only 1% of an estimated 12 million people in India with Hepatitis C (HCV) are actually diagnosed with the liver disease today, said Catharina Boehme, CEO of Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) that works on accelerating development and delivery of affordable diagnostic tests for poverty-related diseases.""In order to capitalise on the (blockbuster oral drugs likeSofosbuvir) that we have now, diagnosis is the bottle neck,"" she said. Cipla and FIND have collaborated to increase access to screening facilities and cheaper diagnostic tools, Boehme said. The Geneva-headquartered non-profit is in the process of negotiating a grant agreement with global health organisation UNITAID and at least a third of the grant would be invested in its project in India, she said. ""Our plan is to work with the UNITAID project and build diagnostic capacity and have this complemented by the Cipla partnership, which will focus on demand creation,"" Boehme said.Sharadd Jain, Cipla Global Access director of operations, said the project will roll out in a few months in places like Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. While FIND would take care of the development of diagnostic tools, Cipla intends to increase demand for HCV treatment through screening programmes and patient education, he said. Cipla will leverage its \'Awareness, Counselling and Treatment of Hepatitis C\' (ACT-C) programme for this purpose as well, Jain said.Early detection of HCV is difficult because the infection often does not show symptoms. Up to 45% of those infected with acute HCV spontaneously clear the viruswithin six monthswithout any treatment, while the remaining develop chronic HCV infection, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). ""Of those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis of the liver is 15%-30%within 20 years,"" it states.Another hurdle to detection is the number of tests it takes to diagnose the disease here-up to six, according to Boehme. These tests are often costly, she added. FIND aims to develop easy-to-use, affordable diagnostic tools with manufacturers in India to reduce the number of steps required to detect HPC. It seeks to replicate in the country its work with US-based molecular diagnostic company Cepheid, which is focused on developing a blood capillary tool that would reduce the process to a one-step diagnostic test.The partnership also aims to deploy simpler tests to patients at their doorstep and reduce diagnosis costs to $5-10 (approximately Rs335-670) per case diagnosed, according to Boehme.A single confirmed case of active HCV infection currently costs more than $100 (approximately Rs6,660) to diagnose, according to Cipla\'s Jain. Even with streamlined testing, the cost of screening would still exceed $30 (approximately Rs2,000), he said.']"

Between last quarter and this quarter, the communication of the management has not been indicating anything of the sort which they have reported as far as the working of the company is concerned. Even if I have to believe that there is a large amount of cost that the company has spent in the area of (a) cleaning of their books, b) restructuring their businesses, it is apparent that thepeoplethey have hired paying handsome packages, have not lived up to the expectation. I do believe that majority of the damage has already been taken place and it is reflected in the price. The fundamentals of the company frankly are not changing much. On the contrary, I think the visibility in form of the ANDAs that they are offering and in form of higher amount of capacities that they have created on the formulation side, could possibly drag the futurebusinessof the company down. But the management should come out with explanations and show transparency.ET Now: I want to discuss OMCs with you. Now that oil prices are nearing $50 per barrel, what will happen to OMCs in the short term?Deven Choksey:That is a pain point. I guess you will have some amount of fielding times for most of the OMCs on the margin front as well. So far in this quarter, they will not have much of an impact because they may have advantage of at least 2-4 weeks at the most on the pipeline inventory of the crude that they are getting at a lower price and I think they would get reasonably better outcome on this front in this quarter.But subsequently, if thecrude oilprices start start coming down from $50, once again you will have a really tough time handling the near term outlook of the OMCs. Generally, I would like to believe that do not look at the OMCs from the quarterly basis point of view because that is not giving any kind of conclusion given the volatility in crude. I would rather think that if four quarters pan out well and the crude oil prices remain in the range of $40-$50, then it should not be seen as bad for OMCs going forward. But now most of the OMCs are adequately priced on valuations. So we do not have much of a view on buying side for these companies for the time being.']"

The company has proved to be a disappointment among the frontline pharma stocks and may remain so in the near term. However, for investors looking at value buys of quality stocks from a longer term perspective - Cipla may just be the right pick at this juncture. Here are the five reasons why one could consider accumulating the stock:1. CoreBusinessStrengths:Management bandwidth and execution has proved to be the sore point in case of Cipla - with investors waiting for the past three to four years for the company to transition its business model. Despite being a late mover in the US genericsmarket, Cipla has a sound strategy and robust manufacturing infrastructure. It has a strong position - being the third largest player - in the domestic and South African generic markets. US business currently contributes 20% of the total revenues. As the proportion of this high margin business grows, it will help improving the company's profitability.2. Prioritising of Markets and Resources:Cipla is restructuring its emerging market resources - exiting from the smaller fringe markets that don't materially add to the revenue but increase complexity in operations. The strategy is to proactively simplify the business and ensuring focus only on 15-20 high growth markets where the company has a leadership position.3. Increased R&D; Spend:From 6 to 6.5% of net sales, Cipla has increased its R&D; spend to 8-8.5% of its net sales. A large portion of this spend would be on differentiated generics and specialty products for the US market.4. Product Pipeline:Aided by its recent buyouts Invagen and Exelan, Cipla is expecting to file 20-25 products and launch 10-15 products in the US this fiscal - with some of them likely to be limited competition opportunities.The company currently has 78 ANDAs pending for approval in the US. Launch of its generic inhaler Advair in theUK, though delayed, remains a latent growth opportunity.5. Attractive Valuations:Having depreciated 30% in the past one year and trading at a price toearningsmultiple of 22.5, Cipla's stock has limited room for a major downside. Its peersSun Pharma,Lupinand Dr Reddy's Labs - with large established businesses in the US are trading at much higher price to earnings multiples of 48, 29 and 26 respectively. Management has conservatively guided for a base business revenue growth in the mid-teens over the medium term with an EBITDA growth of ~15-20%.""]"

But if you see on adjusted EV to EBITDA basis also, it is trading at just four times and EBITDA is Rs 40,000 crore and plus they have now domestic CV cycle which is going in their favour from last two quarters and it will continue because if monsoon picks up and plus infra cycle also picks up, then definitely CV cycle is going to continue and on the global side, they have got their act together in China. Already in US andEurope, they are doing well.ET Now: I have a simple question. I understand that Tata Motors is cheap and it has been a very cheap stock and you compare with Maruti. But Tata Motors has complications. I will have to look at China. I will have to calculate the pound. I will have to look at the movement in CV. I will have to look at the Indian passenger carbusiness. So I am actually inviting 10-12 more complications. Is it worth it?Parag Thakkar:Basically, as you rightly said, there are many moving parts in Tata Motors and that is why it is trading at four times EV/EBITDA on adjusted EV/EBITDA basis. So if I reduce from their EBITDA that Rs 7500 crore which they capitalised, then it is trading at four times EV/EBITDA. Otherwise, it is trading at 2.5 times EV/EBITDA on FY18 basis. Maruti is trading at 13 times EV/EBITDA basis and I continue to like Maruti also. Now again, in Maruti, the yen factor has become very big. From last two days, again yen is appreciating and that is also taking Nikkei down. So every business will have some moving parts and every moving part cannot go in your favour every time. So some times the moving part goes against you in the short term and that gives you opportunity to buy.ET Now: You seem to be particularly keen on the NBFC pocket as well and not without reason. I think the growth numbers have been fantastic. The question is there are so many NBFCs over a wide spectrum which are doing well. How do you narrow down on one or two? Which are the ones that you have narrowed down on and why?Parag Thakkar:Fortunately, we have got very a nice pack of NBFCs where corporate governance is not an issue plus lower interest rates definitely benefit them because most of them at least in the vehiclefinanceside have fixed rate lending side and on the liability side, they have borrowing from banks which can reduce with the base rates. So margin expansion is there plus vehicle sales are doing well. So their AUM is growing, that is the basic story.We had been very bullish on Chola some time ago and now from current prices perspective, I am particularly bullish onSundaram FinanceorMuthoot Finance. Sundaram Finance is extremely conservative. Even this last quarter, two years ahead of RBI'sregulation, they have shifted to 90 days NPA recognition and even after that, their net NPA was below 1 per cent and the business cycle was not as good. So this company and if monsoon and infra cycle both pick up, definitely they will grow at 15 per cent. Plus 27 per cent of their borrowing is from banks. So when banks reduce rates, their margins expand because they have been given loans at a fixed rate for three years. So they will have AUM growth benefit. They will have margin benefit. So earnings can grow at a faster pace.ET Now: Are they not too conservative? I know Sundaram Finance and you can close your eyes and say great corporate governance. You can comparegoldand Sundaram Finance. That is what south Indian investors do. They said why buy gold, buy Sundaram Finance. You talk to some south Indian investors, they would actually...Parag Thakkar:Absolutely. There is queue of deposit holders to deposit their money in Sundaram Finance.ET Now: But they will be conservative, 14-15 per cent is maximum what you will get from them.Parag Thakkar: That is true. Plus do not forget that they have huge value sitting in the subsidiaries which I think market has not taken notice of. If you see their market cap is Rs 15,400 crore, if you do their subsidiary valuation properly because of the listed stocks likeSundaram Clayton,India Motor Partsand various other listed companies. Also the 50 per cent JV with Sundaram BNP Paribas which is a home finance company will do very well now.ET Now: They have stake in AMC business also.Parag Thakkar:Yes. They will grow in affordable housing segment, rural housing segment. So I think that the entire piece is also worth around Rs 4000-4500 crore and it will keep growing. Actually you are getting a core NBFC vehicle financing business at around Rs 11,000 crore and the net worth should be around Rs 4300 crore in FY18, so it is trading at 2.7 times and if you see the parts of the vehicle book, 50 per cent is commercial vehicles which will do well. About 7 per cent is construction equipment which will do very well if the road, infra cycle continues it momentum. Of course, our government has laid out a hugely ambitious path for roads and that will only grow. They have tractors also and tractors will benefit from monsoon. So if the business direction is completely positive, then definitely valuations will also go up.ET Now: Do you track Jyothy Labs?Parag Thakkar:We do not have a coverage but I know the company basically. It is a Rs 5000 crore market cap company. Their cash EPS was around Rs 12.7. So it is trading, giving you 4-4.5 per cent cash flow yield. Anyway FMCG stocks at these prices generally do not fall from here unless there is some very bad negativenewson the competition or the volume side. So it is at a fair level also and some of their brands like Maxo and Exo and even Henko itself are doing well. As we know, this is the last year whenHenkelcan actually pick up the stake. I think the stock might get huge attention this year.""]"

In July 2015, WPI inflation was (-)4.00 per cent.The wholesale inflation last witnessed at a higher level than the July 2016 was in August 2014 at 3.74 per cent.

He also spoke about why his company did not gain much from the pharma boom in the US, and how they were concentrating on saving African lives, rather than US sales.ETNow: Recently, Cipla numbers have disappointed, but now you're trying to restructure and focus on big structural opportunity. What are some of the areas you are working on?Umang Vohra:The US will be a focus area for us, we are under-leveraged in the USsoif you were to look at just our share of makeup vis-à-vis our peers less than 20% of our revenue comes from the US for some of the others it is almost 40% it is our biggest runway for growth. We are hoping to see somenewlaunches coming into the US. Not only are we filing for the future, we are also hoping to launch a large number of products. Coming to legacymarketsinIndiaand South Africa, we will continue to grow the markets. We have demonstrated across several quarters that we can grow faster in South Africa, we are about growing as fast in India as themarketand over the next couple of quarters we are going to be growing significantly faster than market in both of these home markets. As a company we believe we have very deep capabilities both in R&D; as well as in the ability to manufacture these products and Ciplas legacy in the past has just being able to bring and develop products and manufacture them for our partners and we are trying to tweak that equation a little bit. We are trying to move away from just doing it solely for our partners to actually doing it for ourselves now in some of the markets that we choose to operate in and that is a transition we are in, we are going to focus a huge amount in innovation, we have taken R&D; up from levels of 3% to close to 8% now and chances are over the next two to three years that may go up but we are going to fund this R&D; through our own ability and our own internal accruals while making sure that our profit line and ourEBITDAnumbers being to rise in the medium term so that is just what we are excited about.ET Now: At a time when such a large generic market in pharma opened up, why was Cipla not able to monetise on that?Umang Vohra:Ciplas focus at that point in time was elsewhere and it was in saving the billions of lives in Africa that were affected by HIV and AIDS. Financially, the US is always the more attractive market, but Ciplas legacy was always to be for the patients and it did so and it brought $1 a day treatment for the several billion ofpeoplewho were living with HIV in Africa and there is no real way that we can measure either of these sides. I have to say it is not a slam-dunk but Cipla is committed to making the US relatively large market for us like it is for the others.ET Now: What is the update on pending regulatory overhangs in the case ofUSFDAon Indore and InvaGen plants?Umang Vohra:Just to clarify, InvaGen has no pendingFDAissue, the InvaGen issue is resolved the plant has got a CIR and we are manufacturing like we would in any normal day so we do not have any more overhangs on InvaGen. We should be getting to hear from the FDA shortly about Indore and we remain very positive about the fact that we have done as much as we could for the site to remediate. We believe our response is something that the FDA would be happy to read and we are waiting approvals or we are waiting next steps and communication from the FDA. We respect the fact that the FDA takes it time for the citation that it mentioned in its form 483 for Indore but at the same time as a management team we are hopeful about the fact that Indore is a plant that we will be able to manufacture like we are doing today and continue to launch new products from.ET Now: Analysts are waiting for indicators. One is when would base margins convincingly stay above 17%; two is the expected inhaler launch in the US could be ariskto bear case scenario for your company. What would your thought be when it comes to time lines for both of these?Umang Vohra:Let me take both. Both are important in their own way and some of the analysts have got this right. I am not going to duck the question on EBITDA. I think our EBITDA lags and I think there is enough of management focus. We have guided this year to be between 16% to 18% of EBITDA, despite having R&D; at 8%. The first quarter was at 17%. We feel confident about being able to meet the 16% to 18% guidance that we have given out earlier in the year. Having said that, 16% to 18% is not where Cipla wants to be. We are putting in the efforts to get the EBITDA trajectory back. The risks to the bear case is the opportunity to the bull case. The opportunity is that, if Cipla can get an approval for its inhaler products in theUKand incase of US the inhalers is an opportunity that Cipla will pursue. We are a little disappointed that we have not been able to monetise this opportunity as yet. There are just two global companies which have been able to monetise this opportunity before us. And Ciplas endeavour is to be first in such opportunities. The way we are looking at how the regulators are looking at thisproduct, we believe that there is opportunity for us to be in the market at least by theendof this fiscal year. We are still hopeful. It will be a big trigger for the stock and this is Ciplas deep core capability. We supply 70% of the Indian market with inhalers, and for us it is important that we use this capability to be able to launch in the UK and US.ET Now: What are the opportunities you would be chasing? Are you looking at developing new molecules, would you be chasing the good old generic model or are you now seriously trying to Para IV?Umang Vohra:We are trying to sell more and more of our own products and when that happens the R&D; has to increase so that is the path that we are on right now. We believe we have the right capabilities to do it. We are going to be after opportunities which are not necessarily only Para IV but opportunities where because of our capabilities we can be in the market sooner and we can be in the market with products offer the ability to be longer in terms of just a tail of theproduct life cyclewhich effectively means that not many people would be able to make those products. In terms ofcategories, the patents in the US are going to be off largely in the next five to seven years around three broad categories, they are going to be around respiratory, which Cipla is very deep in capabilities with, they are going to be around HIV for which we believe the story is written and Cipla has done relatively well in terms of partnerships or its own ability to launch those products and there are going to be areas around immuno medications and areas around oncology, again two areas where which Cipla is well versed with. So it will be fair to say we would be over indexed in some of these areas. It would be fair to say that we will find a balance in ourportfoliobetween Para IV opportunities as well as opportunities where we think there is no legal outcome that is required in the marketplacebut one where the sustainability of the product revenue stream will be guaranteed. So we will be after all of those opportunities. We have signalled we will be filing this year something like 25 products and hopefully that trajectory will continue for the US.ET Now: What growth do you see in the domestic market and what are the margins in the domesticbusiness?Umang Vohra:India will continue to be the largest market for Cipla and we hope to cross the $1 billion mark in India relatively soon. We are going to introduce products out of our own labs. We have had a very prolific launch calendar whether it is in the area of dermatology, in the area of cardiovascular,or in the area of urology. The latest data shows us to be number three. We are going to be launching products that are either life cycle extensions or products where partners believe Cipla is the best partner to take these products to market. Our Indian business will continue to launch between 3-4% of sales as new products year-on-year. Our deep volume growth in India is going to be strong. We continue to see volume growths of upwards of 8-10% and pricing whenever there is an opportunity allowed by the regime in India I think we are going to be taking them. So India will grow higher than market, we are clearly looking at our India growth to be in the 13-15% range over a larger time period.ET Now: You had earlier guided for EBTIDA margins in the range of about 16-18% for FY17, are you sticking with that and is there a likelihood that you are going to touch that 18% level rather than 16%?Umang Vohra:No. So we are going to be in the range. I think managements vested with trying to get to 18, but we have guided to 16-18 and frankly I think with 8% of R&D; and with the US not at fully at scale as yet hopefully next year will be a very different, if our launches come right. But for this year we are guiding to 16-18 and we will try and be close to 18 but frankly I think the range of 16-18 is good enough for us.ET Now: What growth number are you looking at, either over the next couple of years or a CAGR view over of the next five years?Umang Vohra:CAGR organic growth will be as good as or better than competition and inorganic opportunities will come in as and when they do but we will be better than competition on our organic growth. Cipla has deep capabilities in being able to do that and where others are grappling with the issue of the US reaching a certain size and the challenge of growing it, Cipla is still a novice in the US market. It is still at levels of sub $400 million so we have a large runway to catch up to be a billion dollars and that is frankly the opportunity of growth that we have there. Our domestic market foundation is strong. We will continue to beat market in India, in South Africa and several of the other emerging markets that we operate in. So we will be ahead of competition organically and we will look for the right inorganic opportunities as they come along.ET Now: How do you define completion?Umang Vohra:Whether it is Sun, Lupin, Reddys I think we would like to see them as our competition at this point in time. That is our peer set really. And so we are going to bench ourselves with them. We have a long way to go, these companies are also very good companies and they have got great return ratios and at the same time they are also growing well so we would like to bench ourselves and run the track with them and that is what we are trying to do but I think the core of Cipla is also about the passion we bring in our work. It is about the meaning that we have to patient lives and that is going to be at the core as we keep competing with some of our peers.""]"

Also, several Indian and multinational drug makers have evinced interest in partnering with Cipla, said Vohra, who took over fromSubhanu Saxenathis month.He said both Indian and multinational drug makers are approaching Cipla to partner for the India launch of several products. And so, India will continue to launch 3% to 4% of our sales year-on-year and our volume growth will continue to be upward of 8% to 10%.

The same year, Cipla signed a licensing agreement with Gilead, alongside a bunch of other Indian companies, to market Hepatitis C drug sofosbuvir.An analyst said the plan to reach a billion dollar in India sales in the foreseeable future seems ambitious and may be uphill, unless the company signs deals of substantial size, either for brands or companies or enter into strategic joint ventures with other drug makers.Last year, Cipla changed its reporting structure for sales in the Indian market.

The panel has said the companys preliminary data on safety and efficacy of the trial drug is insufficient.Ciplahad based its application to the panel on the bioequivalence studies with Exubra, an inhalation drug and device combination that was being marked byPfizer. Exubra was withdrawn from the market in 2007 due to slowdown in sales mainly because of issues revolving around product design.In November, theSubject Expert Committee a group comprising experts in diverse fields of endocrinology and metabolism-met and noted, ""The firm (Cipla) has presented BA/BE (bioavailability/bioequivalence) study data and requested for phase IV study which is not acceptable and not scientifically justified with respect to inhaled insulin.""Cipla declined to comment on the development. A year ago, Ciplas application was examined by the same committee. It was directed to establish the safety, efficacy and dose finding study (phase I and II) before carrying out phase III study. That apart, Cipla was asked to provide safety and toxicological data from experimental/animal studies.""The firm should also carry out the coefficient of variation and stability of the device intended to be used for delivering of inhaled/powder insulin,"" the committee had then said in its report.A veteran in clinical research told ET the chances of Cipla getting a green signal appear slim given the issues related to studies to establish safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of the product in the new formulation.However, he said, carrying out large-scale studies and improving on the product design would enable Cipla to prove that it has bettered the safety and technology profile of the product.Although drug makers have explored technological disruptions to deliver insulin in forms other than needles and bring in convenience to the patients, those have met with little success.It was not just Pfizers Exubra that was junked. More recently, French drug maker Sanofi ended its deal with US-based Mannkind which had developed Afrezza.The product could not reach a scale due to lower-than-expected response from prescribers. Novo Nordisk, the biggest insulin maker in the world, recently dropped its project on oral insulin.Instead, it is focusing on a non-insulin drug that can be had as a tablet. Those failures, however, do not take away from Ciplas capabilities in developing products using the inhalation technology.']"

In a chat with ETNow, he says that even as pharma sector may take three or six months to revive, investors should start buyingstocksof some of these companies. Excerpts :-ET Now: In uncertain times like these, would it be the wisest to stick with defensives - the likes of IT or individual pharma stocks? Do you think the tilt of the market is going to be towards these two pockets?Deven Choksey:I am not too sure whether one should shift into IT and pharma completely but the fact remains that both pockets have to meet their own challenges in the given situations, from local as well as global front. The companies are meeting a part of their challenges. I would rather think that instead of going into a particular sector allocation, one will have to look at the companies on an individual basis.Some of the companies in pharma space have become attractive in terms of valuations. That is the time when you can start buying into some of these companies. Considering that you are buying during uncertain times, you still have at least two to three months of accumulation opportunity at current levels. So one can possibly start adding such companies - particularly from the pharma space - where things have started becoming relatively more attractive. It may take another three or six months for the entire space to revive but the fact is that some of the companies are giving you an opportunity at lower levels.ET Now: What are your chosen names from the pharma pack?Deven Choksey:Ciplais among a couple of companies where we have high conviction. It has overcome some of the inefficiencies/extra spending that it did in the last couple of years. On one side, you will see a positive impact because of their cash conservation strategy. On the other side, you are getting a higher amount of visibility as far as the ANDA (Abbreviated New Drug Application) pipeline and launches are concerned.Yesterday,Glenmarkalso reconfirmed the kind of strategy that they have adopted and probably they would like to grow steadily into the global market with regular launches of ANDAs and new products.So certainly, we like companies like Cipla and Glenmark from the pharma pack.Sun Pharmais attractive. I think, they are waiting for some more confirmation on theRanbaxybenefit side. On the domestic turf, the company remains relatively more stable now with lower valuations.ET Now: One of the units ofAurobindo Pharmahas got Form 483 after nine days of inspection. What are your thoughts?Deven Choksey:Well I think maybe one will have to wait for the full details. The stock may trade sideways for at least three to six months till the time clarity emerges.ET Now: What are you telling your clients to do  preserve capital or add more?Deven Choksey:Our target is that whenever you are getting individually good quality stocks available at bargain valuations, one should probably start looking at adding them into the portfolio. We are not adding new names at this point of time. We find that the valuations of some of the existing companies which we have in our model portfolio are becoming attractive.We find good comfort level with some of the auto and auto ancillary companies primarily because of two main reasons. On one side, the government is likely to announce a policy for scrapping of old vehicles. This could possibly revive growth for commercial vehicles particularly. It should also help some of the large auto ancillary companies which are attached to commercial vehicles.Secondly, credit growth is likely to grow further with a low rate of interest. Overall, our view remains relatively stronger with select names in auto.There are companies which are now becoming attractively priced. Some of these are NBFC companies where they are seeing normalcy returning as far as inquiry levels are concerned. We find that eventually some of these companies could possibly do well. So the approach is to keep cash but at the same time, wherever we get attractive valuations, we start deploying money in a systematic manner.ET Now: Give your top three ideas for 2017.Deven Choksey:Wabcohas some good valuations but it has shed it by almost 35 per cent from the peak that it used to command. So comparatively, the stock has become inexpensive. It is a company where you get good amount of opportunity from a long-term investment point of view. Their parents are basically sourcing maximum components from Indian companies. They have got their own software development abilities and at the same time, they are catering to a large segment of commercial vehicle segment. The company remains favourably positioned. So certainly we like it. We believe that it holds the potential to give you at least 50 per cent appreciation over a period of 18 months. So certainly one could consider such kind of investment ideas.The other companies in the portfolio could come from the auto space. We have been likingBajaj Auto. With its new model launches, it is holding good amount of promise to generate a higher amount of top-line. With a bottom line of around Rs 14,000 crore-plus in thebalance sheet, one can always expect better rewards coming in from this company.']"

So we will have our targeted share of the revenue from the opportunity.ET Now: Being responsible on the pricing Mylan, I believe had launch the generic at a 15% discount what would be your strategy?

As I said generally we withhold our comments on the overall revenue contribution or market share etc. but we will be able to comment as we go forward and experience the launch in the market.ET Now: What about the US plan this is Europe, this is UK, what about US?Kedar Upadhye:So this launch sense is a validation of our capabilities respiratory complex product development and approval process with western regulatory agencies.

The bottom line growth is largely on the basis of further income growth while margins are below 20 odd per cent. Within the pharma space, we are quite selective given the fact that the entire space is not performing. Lupin again remains a top pick for us.Largely there are no regulatory challenges for the company. Though we have not seen a proportionate price appreciation in the stock, besides that, Glenmark Pharma is another stock which we like. The results were quite good and we are quite optimistic on the US growth plus we also see domestic growth of about 13 odd per cent.Overall, we are expecting a good set of numbers wherein top line growth could be 14 odd per cent and bottom line growth could be far higher. Since the company is already one of the big R&D; spenders, we have not taken any commercialisation or monetisation of their R&D; pipeline but we still expect this stock to do well, given the fact that it has not done much in the past two years.Any takeaways or expectations that you would have from Aurobindo Pharma and Lupin considering how stark the underperformance has been from the pharma universe?For Lupin, we are expecting a good set of numbers and expect overall revenues to grow by 22 odd per cent. The US market has seen a growth of about 41 odd per cent, largely because of new product launches plus the Gavis acquisition. Even the Japanese market is expected to do well for Lupin and that should lead to good bottomline growth. We expect the margins to be in the range of 24 to 25 odd per cent. Probably the entire top line growth may not translate into bottom line growth and that is why we expect a bottom line growth of about 18 odd per cent. Overall, we are expecting decent set of numbers.There was nothing grand with the ACC numbers. There is a huge concern about the underlying valuations that both Ambuja and ACC are commanding. What explains this liking for cement and especially for ACC and Ambuja?Largely, for ACC, if you look at though it appears or though it is a large cap company in terms of capacity but your margin profile and return ratios are that of midcap and which is why this company keeps getting multiples of midcap. Ambuja is slightly better off and eventual consolidation would benefit Ambuja more compared to ACC, which is why we have a bias towards Ambuja.Within cement sector, south appears to be a region with a standout in demand growth especially from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. All south-based players have been reporting fairly stable set of numbers with expansion in EBITDA per tonne. So we like a company like India Cement wherein we have seen good set of numbers and the south-based players will continue to do well for entire India as well. We need to look at the second half. Till that time, we would expect softer numbers for most of the other players which are largely based in north India.']"

So what do you require to have a healthy India, what we actually require and this is something the government should seriously consider is no monopoly in healthcare, free competition is the only way prices will come down, particularly if there are no monopolies for some of the latest and most valuable essential drugs.So we have to therefore have a pragmatic compulsory licensing policy to enable India to look after its own people. On a global front, India has done remarkably well in both IT and pharma. 30% of all the medicines used in America the origin is India. So that is something fantastically good. At the same time I have said India in pharma is very much dependent on China. And that is something that the government should seriously consider that for essential medicines we must be independent of China.For example, penicillin, there is nopenicillinmanufactured in India. It is must, irrespective of the cost. India must produce its own penicillin so that India has its ownampicillin, its own amoxicillin, its owncephalexin, the whole range of antibiotics is dependent on penicillin. If you do not have penicillin you cannot produce these antibiotics.ET Now: How do you view the government policy and the direction taken in the union budget, I mean, does it create the impetus that healthcare is looking for?YK Hamied:I think, the budget and finance personally has little bearing on my thinking. I think in pharma we beat all that by knowledge creation and I think that is the key to our success that we in the pharma because of obsolescence, I mentioned it earlier, you have to keep on innovating. The pharma industry is not like cement or sugar where you go on making it year in year out and there is no change. Here the older drugs die and newer drugs come on.ET Now: What is going to be the key growth areas for Cipla over the next couple of years, will there be a renewed focus on the domestic market?YK Hamied:I sincerely believe that the government here should have policies stretching over five years, not policies that keep on changing three months and six months. I will give you a live example, in 2004-2005 Ciplaâs total exports were 10%, we were concentrating on the domestic markets, today 35% is domestic 65% is exports. By the government policies you are pushing industry outside India. Why do not you have a pragmatic policy here, not reducing prices the whole time, let water find its own level. Prices should be based on free competition.']"

I actually think that there is operating leverage. For this leverage to be more in the future, we need to have more unlocking in the US pipeline, which is what most analysts are also saying. In terms of the three quarters or four quarters that have gone, the operating leverage has been there. Every analysts that we have spoken to has told us that it is there and it is unfolded but going forward is the challenge and that is dependent on the US launches.ET Now: No I get your point that you are saying that you are staying with your guidance margins but it is very low compared to what the industry average is. Now let us say an investor is looking at two companies, he will obviously want the company which is showing growth, is showing decent margins. 18% to 19% is a decent margin but it is not compared to a globalpharmagiant like the other peers that you have.Umang Vohra:Yes, I agree with that. I am not going to say that Ciplaâs margins are superior to the rest of the industry. We have always said that we are at bottom end.But the path for this marginâ¦ there are two ways to do it. We can cut R&D.; We can cut everything and show two years of margin going up to 23%. We are trying to structurally change the business and we have to understand that Cipla employs almost 30,000 people. So, we are trying to structurally change the business to get those superior margin profile. We have closed geographies that did not make sense to us. We have tried to restructure Europe and each element of this is a human decision. It is not easy to do those right away.If you were to take out a huge share of the US businesses that the others have, I am very confident that Ciplaâs margin profile is better than most of the players in the industry. Therefore, what Cipla needs is the unfolding of the US business because that business I know because it is a much superior margin profile than any of the other businesses in that we run around the world. Once the US begins to unlock, you will see Ciplaâs margin profile increase quite dramatically from where it is.ET Now: When will it unlock because you are the late entrant anyway in theUS marketso that thing we have take into consideration but to bring or make that front end move there or build that will take a lot of time, so how much time are you envisaging for the US markets to kick start now?Umang Vohra:It depends on our approvals because whether the street knows it or not but we have launched 18 products that is as much as anybodyâs else has launched in the US in the past one year. I think our capabilities to launch products, etc, are all there. The question is how quickly will we get approvals from theFDA. Our quality of filings is frankly pretty good.I do not feel uncomfortable about what we filed but there is a journey, there is a time difference between the time you file and the time you get approval and very often it is 12 to 18 months in todayâs scenario. We started our filing some time back, about six months back. So, I would say it will begin to unfold. It is not going to happen in the next quarter. It will take two quarters to unfold but it is coming and will I be overly concerned if we miss it even by a quarter? No, I would not because I think the street can have its own view on where the company is going but internally we have a plan for the organisation and we are working to that plan.ET Now: As far as the US market is concerned, what is theANDApipeline that you have and you already spoke about that you have a fairly large, give us a number what the ANDA pipeline and as you know a Para IV will probably change fortunes for lot of companies, any drugs in this Para IVs.Umang Vohra:We have several Para IVs and several of them are soles, several of them are shared. We are also trying to get into categories of products which are outside of the Para IV, where it may not necessarily be that you earn all your money in six months but that you also have a longer period and a longer tail to earn to supply the market in a limited manner and I think those are the type of products that we are after as well.We are filing 25 to 30 products every year and we intend to do the same next year as well and once these 25 and 30 start reaching approval, we will have a very good, I would say very strong launch pipeline but it is not going to happen overnight.ET Now: At the end of the third quarter conference call you had said that there were delays into products by the US officials what were the issues which are these products and when can we see them coming back into the fold?Umang Vohra:There were two products. We are not giving you the names. One is, obviously there is nobody who has launched it and because nobody has got approval so the FDA has taken its time. Actually there are two such products where the FDA taking its time to adjudicate for both the products. There was one product, where we have received more queries we have to go back. We are working with the FDA to resolve it so there were these three products and I think I am hopeful that we will see at least one launch in quarter one may be towards the end of quarter one and then the rest of them coming up after that.ET Now: If you cannot name the products can you give a market size of how big these products are to get an idea what can we anticipate from Cipla over the next quarters?Umang Vohra:Yes, I would say each of these products could from 10 to 15 million.ET Now: Inhaler is a big business for you, you have always looking to grow there. What is the strategy for the inhaler business and especially what is the traction for the Seretide launch?Umang Vohra:Let us do Seretide first. Seretide, we are actually looking for a market share very similar to how a comparative launch before us got to right which is roughly about I would say about 15% to 20% range in a yearâs time. I think that the economics can be worked out based on that but that is how we are looking at Seretide in the UK.The inhaler business, we have always maintained is one of the very strong business for Cipla and we will try and go after as many products we can in the US. I believe we filed quite a few. We are public about the fact that some of our partners have filings with us as well and we are public about the fact that we are going to go after that so it is a big franchise for us we will build it out.ET Now: What about because you even tried front end in Europe probably that did not work out as much as you thought you could probably close down little bit what is the strategy there, what are you looking to do now?Umang Vohra:Europe for us will be we have three markets left everything else is a business to business model. By and large, Europe will be a B to B model for us. We realise pretty early on that if we were to set up a force to do respiratory, it would have to complete with the likes ofAstraZenecaandGSKso we were not only competing with generics we were now competing with branded companies and if we had to grow the US it was a huge amount of drain on our resources so we had to prioritise one over the other. Europe will be a B to B model. We will be very happy to partner all our inhaler products or any other products in Europe and we are going to be cherry-picking assets that makes sense for us.ET Now:InvaGenthat is the latest acquisition that you did the numbers are not clearly showing what is happening there or what can we expect?Umang Vohra:InvaGen is actually on track with what we had wanted to do in first year. We are okay with InvaGen and we have no concern about the numbers. I think the market, the street is probably running ahead of what it wants InvaGen to do but that will only happen once InvaGenâs products get approved. So, if there is no approval of a product that is fundamentally it is a commodity generic business. It cannot grow without that but we are on track.ET Now: I think the street was running a little ahead of InvaGen.Umang Vohra:I would imagine so.ET Now: But what about FDA concerns, what is the update on theGoa plant?Umang Vohra:Goa plant anytime now we hope that the FDA will adjudicate on it I cannot give you on whether I think the FDA will either approve not approve etc that is their call. We believe we have worked with the FDA. We believe we have answered all the queries they had from our inspection. We have seen product approvals after that from Goa facility so while we do not have the EIR, we think that Goa that it is now in the process and hopefully the FDA will let us know their final adjudication.ET Now: You all are happy with the way Cipla is moving, R&D; cost will be elevated and anyway expect you do not expect a big jump as far as margin is concerned it will be gradual. What is your vision and what can come out of Cipla at least if you can give some numbers financially over the next two years for a shareholder for Cipla?Umang Vohra:Numbers for next year will be given now is not the time, we gave a guidance in the previous year of 16 to 18 we have hit that guidance where you guys have told me that you have hit the guidance as well. So obviously, that is registered whether with shareholders or with analysts or with the media, we will give a guidance for next year.I told you longer term, we want to take a margin profile up to about 22-23% that is what we are working on and we think that this could happen in the next three to five years. And like I mentioned, from 16 to 22-23 is a huge movement along with keeping the R&D; flowing up so we could move from 18 this year to 22 of next year by bringing R&D; down to 5% but that is not what we want to do. While keeping R&D; here or higher, we want to move to the 22-23% direction in the next three to five years that is the number that you want. The more near term numbers, we will give with our next analyst call.""]"

Back home, Rs 350 crore went into setting up a biotech manufacturing plant in Goa. But, in less than a year, newCiplaCEO Umang Vohra pulled the plug on the African project this summer as part of major restructuring that involved exiting non-core and low profit businesses. He also announced that the company would not remain an active player in the biosimilars space, even if it meant a Rs 57-crore write-off.Both the biosimilars under development â one of which hit clinical trials â were under the scanner for potential offloading. âIn biotech, it is more important to be first to the market than have possible lower cost of drug,â explained Vohra. âAs a result, we have tweaked the business model to say we wonât be relying solely on our manufacturing.âTHE REVOLVING DOORGlasnost is good. And Cipla under Hamied and his trusted brain trust, former joint MD Amar Lulla, has always been defiant and disruptive, especially since the turn of the century. But in the past six years, since Lulla passed away in 2011, the incessant change of strategy, precipitated largely by the regular churn of leadership, has left the company hamstrung.Delay in ramping up business in developed markets and strategy U-turns compounded by lacklustre performance in domestic and emerging markets have resulted in stagnant market share and decelerating margins and return on capital employed.The stock has been the second worst performer on the pharma index since 2010. From being the third most valuable Indian pharma company in market cap at end of fiscal 2011, its down to no. 5. When the BSE Healthcare Index returned a whopping 261% from 2010 till date, Ciplaâs returns stood at a meagre 60%.âIt was considered the Unilever of Indian pharma, commanding huge respect among peers. But today, Cipla has become a revolving door. Where is the stability?â asks a Mumbai-based chief executive from a rival generics company, on condition of anonymity.In the past six years, Cipla has had seen two different CEOs, as many COOs, four different CFOs, among others. Two years ago, Kamil Hamied, groomed to be his uncleâs legatee, left just when he was about to be anointed, leading to his sisterâs promotion. Heads of Europe and US operations â key geographies for any pharma major âFrank PietersandTim Creware both gone.Subhanu Saxena, the managing director who was hired from Novartis in 2012, also left in four years once profits slumped, after having brought on board a motley bunch of senior managers from investment banking, consulting, industry and consumer backgrounds.Saxena accelerated growth through inorganic expansion in a bid to set up front ends in markets it was present in. For a company averse to mergers and acquisitions for years, Cipla in 2013 acquired its distribution partner Medpro in South Africa, Invagen and Exelan in the US, made acquisitions in Uganda, Brazil and forged joint ventures in Morocco.However, that acquisitive strategy changed overnight to divesting of nonaccretive businesses after former COO Umang Vohra replaced Saxena in the corner office in 2016.The new strategy involves having frontend presence in key markets including India, the US and South Africa. In other geographies, the intention is to revert to the old model of business partnerships. In the past year, Cipla has exited from nearly 30 countries, including the front-end of the European business. Even high-profile projects including biosimilars were not spared.In the quarter ended March 2017, the company has taken a one-time impairment charge of $32 million towards litigation and regulatory developments for certain specific assets of Invagen, representing 6% of the overall value of the acquisition.âWherever we find we are not best suited to play the game, we have exited those businesses. We exited Europe as a frontend model and this year, we have had a phenomenally profitable business. Same with biotech; we realised manufacturing-wise it is not important for biotech and manufacturing is not a skill-set for biodrugs in India; these skill-sets reside outside of India,â explains Vohra.The stress of the transition and restructuring is getting reflected on the companyâs financials and the immediate and obvious fallout has been a bulging salary bill. Employee cost constitutes 18% of revenues in fiscal 2017 â one of the highest among its peers. At a 26% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), the employee cost in the past five years has grown at a much faster rate than the 15% growth in revenues â an aspect common to peers.The operating profit margin has been deteriorating each year since the past five years â pegged at 17% in FY17 â while the return on capital employed has dropped to 14% in FY16 from a high of 24% in FY10. Similarly, the return on net worth has decelerated from 21% to 12% over the same period.In a changing paradigm of global generic consolidation, Cipla found its leveraging power diminishing vis-Ã -vis their global alliance partners, who either got acquired or set up their own backend, feels Sanjiv Kaul, partner with PE firm ChrysCapital, a veteran investor and pharma industry expert. âMore importantly, Cipla never really kept up with the times to bring in the right outside talent. Unlike Dr Reddyâs, Cadila and Lupin, they did not focus internally on succession planning and talent development.With the result, when the triumvirate moved on, the organisation found itself under pressure and relinquishing some of its core strengths and values. Much later, they tried to do a course correction with induction of a new set of leadership but sadly they were found to be culturally a misfit there and soon left,â he adds.A NEW MORNINGThe structural change that the current team â led by Umang Vohra, Kedar Upadhye and Prabir Jha, with Vaziralli representing the promoter family â has initiated, is striving for a superior margin profile. âWe are very clear where we are headed. We are principally creating a destiny for Cipla that links with its core business strengths and purpose with our core geographies,â argues Vohra. âRespiratory is a core strength, so is oncology and HIV.âIndia will predominantly be a consumer health or generics play. Equally strategic is South Africa and the US. Instead of the biosimilars bet, Cipla would rather invest to create a specialty pipeline around respiratory drugs in the US, where it is open for takeovers. âYou will see us doing a lot more on these therapies and these markets, but we are going to focus deeper and deeper in areas we are strong,â Vohra adds.The management and promoters downplayed the impact of management churn and did not respond to ETâs detailed questionnaire till the time of going to press. The trio of Vohra, Upadhye and Jha â known as the âReddy gangâ for their common Dr Reddyâs pedigree â has eyes firmly on the US market, even when it has been at its volatile best for most Indian players. Price erosion is forcing most to review their business case but Ciplaâs captains believe âit is still an opportunity, and not a threat.âHaving a smaller presence than most domestic rivals may finally pay off in the most ironical of ways. âWe are principally building a business that is doing lesser but doing definitive,â claims Vohra. Indeed, there are green shoots visible.The companyâs filing trajectory has improved with 32 Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) filed in the US in FY17. The outlook seems encouraging with the launch of some limited competition products during the current fiscal.The expenditure on research & development (R&D;) too has been increased and is likely to be maintained at 8-8.5% of the net sales in FY18.âThe management expects 20+ launches from FY18 onwards... and with a couple of these being limited competition opportunities in the US, we see Ciplaâs inhalation pipeline more meaningful in the US (as compared to the European Union),â says analyst Hemant Bakhru at UBS.But the companyâs concentrated focus on inhalers â some not getting materialised due to gaps in R&D; â also makes it vulnerable in a market where multiple uncertainties around regulatory filings and approvals have heightened. âA key risk for Ciplaâs estimates and valuation is the delay in execution of the ANDA pipeline, as the US is an important contributor to estimated growth over the next few years,â cautions Neha Manpuria, pharma analyst at JP Morgan.But to successfully transition from selling generics in a partnership model to having its own front-ends in the US will not be easy and is fraught with uncertainties. âThe US pipeline lacks depth versus Indian peers,â wrote Sameer Baisiwala and Vaibhav Dusad of Morgan Stanley last month.A double whammy could also be losing the mojo in emerging markets, the X factor that made Cipla under Hamied the renegade maverick of low-cost drugs. âIt is essentially an emerging market story and it is 20 years late in the US,â said a former senior executive of the company who did not wish to be quoted. âToday, with Sun, Aurobindo and Lupin heading towards emerging markets, Cipla seems to be losing that edge.âFor an 82-year-old that has been late in developing complex generics, innovative products and establishing front-end presence, will a takeover by MNCs like Teva or local innovators like Serum Institute then be the miracle cure? Vaziralli, a former Goldman Sachs banker, remains dismissive of such repeated speculation. âThe market has the conviction that Cipla is a well-oiled machinery,â she quips.The 41-year old former finance graduate from London School of Economics has already spearheaded two crucial buyouts in the US to established a platform for Ciplaâs future growth there and is now trying to relentlessly prune costs and hire the right talent. âI am very much part of the company, but the day-to-day running of the business is with our CEO and we are very clear on the responsibilities. A lot of the decisions are taken jointly.âItâs was never gling to be easy to step into the boots of Hamied and balance the Gandhian spirit of conscious capitalism that embodies the core of Cipla with managing the aspirations of investors. In a sector that still worships personalities, comparisons with Lupinâs Vinita Gupta are somewhat of an occupational hazard for Vaziralli.From its heyday in the 80s and 90s, Cipla today they find itself at a crossroads, with the market dynamics and competitive landscape changing dramatically. But, even today, the stock commands a premium â trading at 25 times its estimated earnings for FY18 compared to 18-23 times in case of its peers â on the back of a strong legacy and absence of serious regulatory issues. As Kaul puts it, âIt needs to reinvent itself on a war footing to reoccupy its lost glory and audacity.â The clock is ticking.']"

These treatments are only used by about 8% of patients who should be treated worldwide mainly due to the high costs of these drugs.","[""Cipla Ltd announced this week that its proposed biotech subsidiary in South Africa will invest just over R1.3 billion into the country's first state-of-the-art biotech manufacturing facility, for the production of biosimilars. Cipla Ltd is a global pharmaceutical company and owner of Cipla Medpro, South Africas third largest pharmaceutical manufacturer, as well as Cipla BioTec, a biotechnology company focused on affordable and accessible biopharmaceuticals.Steven Lehrer, Director of Cipla BioTec said that Biosimilars are important to enable access to advanced cancer and autoimmune treatments. These treatments are only used by about 8% of patients who should be treated worldwide mainly due to the high costs of these drugs. Biosimilars are as safe and effective as the original treatment and are starting to be introduced worldwide. However, biosimilars remain too expensive for broad use outside of major western markets. Cipla BioTec aspires to transform the biosimilars market worldwide, by significantly increasing access with its strategy of one global product standard at affordable pricing. Cipla BioTecs unique manufacturing strategy is leveraged from its in house proprietary manufacturing software and single use technology.According to both Paul Miller, CEO of Cipla Medpro and Divian Govender, CEO of the proposed entity Cipla BioTec South Africa, the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Narendra Modi, is in South Africa on the 8th of July 2016 and Cipla BioTec has been invited to attend the Prime Ministers keynote address. Prior to the event, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Cipla BioTec Pvt Ltd and Dube Tradeport Corporation will be signed. The MOU affirms Cipla BioTecs and Dube Tradeport Corporations commitment for the investment and outlines terms of reference for the project.Govender adds that the factory, which will be located in the Department of Trade and Industries Special Economic Zone of Dube Tradeport in Durban, will manufacture biosimilar drugs made from living organisms and used in the treatment of cancer and other diseases. Biosimilars are designed to have the same characteristics as an original biological agent. Construction is scheduled to start in early 2017, with full operations expected to commence in the third quarter of 2018.Lehrer states that, at full capacity, the facility is expected to create upto 300 jobs (upto 180 high skilled jobs and 120 indirect jobs), primarily in the engineering and biological science fields. It marks the entrance of Cipla Ltd subsidiary, Cipla BioTec, into South Africa and will be run independently of the pharmaceuticals existing manufacturing division, Cipla Medpro Manufacturing (CMM).The Minister of Health Aaron Motsoaledi was recently quoted in the press that he is extremely concerned of the high costs of medical care, using cancer drugs as an example. He further commented: Just as the price of ARVS were unaffordable then cancer drugs are devilishly unaffordable today. He called for the same effort that was used to reduce the price of ARVS to be used in the fight against other diseases. The Minister highlighted that a breast cancer patient could pay up to R500 000 for Herceptin, for a years treatment. This makes it virtually unaffordable for both the private and public sector.In the light of this, Miller explains that in South Africa, people without access to private insurance have limited or no access to any biologic medicine due to the very high prices of the innovator molecules. Currently about 1-in-50 patients in Africa, have access to biologic medication. We are striving to reduce this number to about 1-in-5 cancer patients through the production and supply of biosimilar medication at an affordable price. This embraces Cipla ethos of advancing healthcare for all.The biosimilars produced at the facility will be for both state and private sectors and there is also the potential to export to markets in the US, European Union and Asia, explains Miller. The capacity of this factory will have the potential for a vast majority of the products to be exported, thereby contributing significantly to the countrys economic growth and skill development.Subhanu Saxena, MD & Global CEO, Cipla Ltd. said, Ciplas investment in this facility will enable the creation of the first Bio-cluster on the African continent. A state-of-the-art, worldclass manufacturing base here in South Africa will allow opportunities for supply chain partners and related companies to get involved. This in turn will allow top-notch research efforts to stay in South Africa and attract research from international institutions as well.The biotech manufacturing facility will have the necessary design capacity and capabilities and will seek regulatory approvals to supply the local market, and to export into the rest of Africa and Europe.This investment follows the launch of the new distribution centre, Cipla Distribution Gateway in 2015, which saw a R185-million investment into the country as well as a recent R400-million upgrade to the existing manufacturing facility in KZN, concludes Miller.""]"

These treatments are only used by about 8% of patients who should be treated worldwide mainly due to the high costs of these drugs.","[""Cipla Ltd announced this week that its proposed biotech subsidiary in South Africa will invest just over R1.3 billion into the country's first state-of-the-art biotech manufacturing facility, for the production of biosimilars. Cipla Ltd is a global pharmaceutical company and owner of Cipla Medpro, South Africaâs third largest pharmaceutical manufacturer, as well as Cipla BioTec, a biotechnology company focused on affordable and accessible biopharmaceuticals.Steven Lehrer, Director of Cipla BioTec said that âBiosimilars are important to enable access to advanced cancer and autoimmune treatments. These treatments are only used by about 8% of patients who should be treated worldwide mainly due to the high costs of these drugs. Biosimilars are as safe and effective as the original treatment and are starting to be introduced worldwide. However, biosimilars remain too expensive for broad use outside of major western markets. Cipla BioTec aspires to transform the biosimilars market worldwide, by significantly increasing access with its strategy of one global product standard at affordable pricing. Cipla BioTecâs unique manufacturing strategy is leveraged from its in house proprietary manufacturing software and single use technology.âAccording to both Paul Miller, CEO of Cipla Medpro and Divian Govender, CEO of the proposed entity Cipla BioTec South Africa, the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Narendra Modi, is in South Africa on the 8th of July 2016 and Cipla BioTec has been invited to attend the Prime Ministerâs keynote address. Prior to the event, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Cipla BioTec Pvt Ltd and Dube Tradeport Corporation will be signed. The MOU affirms Cipla BioTecâs and Dube Tradeport Corporationâs commitment for the investment and outlines terms of reference for the project.Govender adds that the factory, which will be located in the Department of Trade and Industries Special Economic Zone of Dube Tradeport in Durban, will manufacture biosimilar drugs made from living organisms and used in the treatment of cancer and other diseases. Biosimilars are designed to have the same characteristics as an original biological agent. Construction is scheduled to start in early 2017, with full operations expected to commence in the third quarter of 2018.Lehrer states that, at full capacity, the facility is expected to create upto 300 jobs (upto 180 high skilled jobs and 120 indirect jobs), primarily in the engineering and biological science fields. âIt marks the entrance of Cipla Ltd subsidiary, Cipla BioTec, into South Africa and will be run independently of the pharmaceuticalâs existing manufacturing division, Cipla Medpro Manufacturing (CMM).âThe Minister of Health Aaron Motsoaledi was recently quoted in the press that he is extremely concerned of the high costs of medical care, using cancer drugs as an example. He further commented: âJust as the price of ARVâS were unaffordable then cancer drugs are devilishly unaffordable today.â He called for the same effort that was used to reduce the price of ARVâS to be used in the fight against other diseases. The Minister highlighted that a breast cancer patient could pay up to R500 000 for Herceptin, for a yearâs treatment. This makes it virtually unaffordable for both the private and public sector.In the light of this, Miller explains that in South Africa, people without access to private insurance have limited or no access to any biologic medicine due to the very high prices of the innovator molecules. Currently about 1-in-50 patients in Africa, have access to biologic medication. âWe are striving to reduce this number to about 1-in-5 cancer patients through the production and supply of biosimilar medication at an affordable price. This embraces Cipla ethos of advancing healthcare for all.âThe biosimilars produced at the facility will be for both state and private sectors and there is also the potential to export to markets in the US, European Union and Asia, explains Miller. âThe capacity of this factory will have the potential for a vast majority of the products to be exported, thereby contributing significantly to the countryâs economic growth and skill development.âSubhanu Saxena, MD & Global CEO, Cipla Ltd. said, Ciplaâs investment in this facility will enable the creation of the first Bio-cluster on the African continent. âA state-of-the-art, worldclass manufacturing base here in South Africa will allow opportunities for supply chain partners and related companies to get involved. This in turn will allow top-notch research efforts to stay in South Africa and attract research from international institutions as well.âThe biotech manufacturing facility will have the necessary design capacity and capabilities and will seek regulatory approvals to supply the local market, and to export into the rest of Africa and Europe.âThis investment follows the launch of the new distribution centre, Cipla Distribution Gateway in 2015, which saw a R185-million investment into the country as well as a recent R400-million upgrade to the existing manufacturing facility in KZN,â concludes Miller.""]"

The high\xa0potency, high barrier to resistance, pangenotypic activity, once-daily dosage, good safety\xa0profile and the limited drug-drug interactions of sofosbuvir makes it a breakthrough drug in\xa0hepatitis C treatment.

The segment alone\xa0contributed about one-fifth to Ciplas sales of Rs 14,630 crore in FY17.Cipla Respiratory segment includes range of products including pills, nasal sprays and inhalers to treat asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Allergic Rhinitis (AR), among others.In China, respiratory diseases are the second largest cause of deaths. It is estimated that of the 100 million Chinese  who are thought to have asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  only 30 percent have been diagnosed and only 5 million are receiving any kind of treatment.Currently, international pharmaceutical firms such as GSK, Astrazeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck and Novartis dominate the Chinese respiratory market.This\xa0is not the first time Cipla is entering China. It has earlier invested in\xa0Jiangsu-based drug maker Cdymax predominantly involved in making active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) some formulations. The comapny has also invested in BioMab, which is focused on developing biosimilars for the Chinese market.Cipla has exited both these investments.China despite its large size remains a tough market for Indian drug makers to gain toehold due to competition, slow pace of approvals and the government's\xa0 rule to collaborate with local companies and technology transfers.""]"

Its adjusted net leverage (adjusted net debt/EBIDTA) deteriorated to 2.13x in financial year 2016 from 1.17x in a year-ago period, higher than the agency's earlier estimates.The synergies/benefits arising on account of the company's US-based acquisition from business and financial perspectives are yet to be accrued to Cipla and the final impact of the potential outgo on account of the NPPA demand is yet to be seen. This could delay recovery in the company's credit profile, Ind-Ra said.The agency said it expects to resolve the ratings watch within six months.Cipla acquired the US-based Invagen Pharmaceuticals Inc and its marketing arm Exelan Pharmaceuticals Inc in an all -cash debt funded deal of USD 550 million in financial year 2016.As indicated in the annual report for financial year 2016, Mumbai-based Cipla has outstanding cumulative demand notices to the tune of Rs 17.68 billion and has not made any provisions towards this NPPA liability.The RWN indicates the rating could be either affirmed or downgraded. Ind-Ra placed long-term issuer rating 'IND AAA' on RWN. Provisional 'IND AAA' rating of the pharma major's proposed Rs 20 billion NCD was also placed on RWN.Cipla has more than 2,000 products in therapeutic categories with over 40 dosage forms covering a wide spectrum of diseases.

On the downside, once the significant support zone between 8653 and 8633 gets taken out, expect an attempt to retest the 8600-mark.

Margins in Q4 were hurt due to ongoing investment phase and certain adjustments in costs. The stock fell over 7 percent intraday on Wednesday.Investors are worried about management guidance of mid-teen sales growth on the base business (ex-Nexium) over the next three years and\xa0EBITDA growth of 15-20 percent. The company has said that continued investment in research and development (R&D) medium-term for growth may further pressurise near-term margins.Analysts are also cautious as margins remained a drag in Q4.Morgan Stanleyhas an underweight rating on the stock with a target of Rs 440 per share. Though it feels that benefits will be gradual, it says that FY16 has reset base business profitability a lot lower.On a consolidated basis, total revenues were Rs 3260 crore in Q4, driven mainly by domestic business. The pharma major has posted net profit of Rs 80.87 crore (down 69 percent) for the fourth quarter.CLSAalso has an underperform rating with a target of Rs 515 per share. The brokerage firm says that Q4FY16 miss and delays in key drivers lead to 18-22 percent cuts in 17-18 earnings per share (EPS). It expects FY17 to be another tough year for Cipla as margin pressure continues due to high R&D spend (8 percent of sales) along with rationalisation activities in certain markets and the product portfolio.Goldman Sachshas retained sell rating on Cipla and lowered EBITDA by 2-4 percent to factor in weaker outlook for margins. It has also reduced target price to Rs 467 per share.Macquariehas downgraded the stock to neutral rating on with a reduced target of Rs 550 from Rs 680 per share. EBITDA margin was impacted by several one-offs on inventory write-off /reduction of 340 basis points (bps), restructuring charges of 210 bps and regulatory one-offs adjusted for which margin was 13.6 percent. While the brokerage firm is positive on the long-term potential of its initiatives, it believes current valuations have potential for improvement.Bank of America Merill Lynchreiterates neutral rating and cuts estimates by 13-21 percent over FY17-18 and slashed target price to Rs 520 per share. Cipla plans to launch 13-17 products in the US in FY17 and targets to file additional 20-25 ANDAs including respiratory and oncology products.However,Deutsche Bankstill maintains buy rating on the stock with a target of Rs 550 per share. It has also cut EPS estimates by 13.9/11.3 percent for FY17/18, respectively, to incorporate higher operating costs. It feels that Cipla's operating leverage will play out as business restructuring nears end.At 10:43 hrs Cipla was quoting at Rs 466.20, down Rs 28.70, or 5.80 percent on the BSE.Follow @NasrinzStory""]"

Last year, the drug notched up sales of USD 8.25 billion for GSK. It lost patent protection in 2012.The immediate addressable opportunity for Cipla remains small. According to a Bank of America-Merrill Lynch report, sales for MDI stood at USD 40 million and USD 20 million for Germany and Sweden, respectively, but Cipla has applied for approvals for 10 markets in Europe, including in the UK, where the market size stands at USD 432 million.In an interviewwith Bloomberg recently, Cipla chairman Yusuf Hamied had said it was hoping to get approval from UK as early as end of the year.The overall market for Advair is USD 2.4 billion in Europe  of which a third is from the MDI version.This is a significant development for Cipla as it instills the confidence that time has come for the company to monetize its respiratory franchise in the developed markets, BoA-ML said in its report. We believe Advair MDI will remain a limited-competition opportunity for a prolonged period.It added that even if the generic launch results in a 30 percent price erosion and provides a 30 percent market share for Cipla, sales of about USD 150 million (or Rs 900 crore) could accrue for the company.According to the brokerage, this implies a net present value of Rs 70 per share for the company, which notched up net profits of Rs 1,416 crore on sales of Rs 10,100 crore last year.The greater promise, however, lies in the lucrative US market where Cipla plans to submit an application this year.For long, Cipla has been strait-jacketed as an emerging-markets player even as it shot to fame  and some controversy  whenUS Big Pharma criticized itfor selling anti-AIDS drugs in Africa for less than a hundredth of what they sold for.Hamied told Bloomberg he was aiming to increase the companys revenues from the US market from 9 percent currently to 20 percent by 2020. For this, generic Advair remains a key goal the Indian drugmaker will need to achieve  it will change the face of Cipla, the chairman told the news agency  even as analysts believe a US launch could be some years away.But already, Cipla faces competition from a rival drugmaker, Mylan, which plans to file an application for the copy and is aiming to launch by 2016.']"

The company benefitted from strong growth in domestic formulations and export formulations in the nonUS market. This has resulted in favourable product mix in Q1FY15 and helped in 460 bps increase in EBITDA margin to adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.7% in Q1FY15. Strong flow of technology income and export incentive of Rs 72.8 crore helped in 18% QoQ growth in adjusted PAT of Rs 294 crore in Q1FY15.During the con-call, management guided about launches of 50 products in US (Majority of these products fall in therapies such as anti-infectives, oncology injections and respiratory products) over next 2-3 years and combination inhalers in EU in H2FY15. Moreover, Meda (CL partner for Dymista) has highlighted increasing market share in the US and EU. Hence there can be higher milestone payments from Meda in the coming quarters.\xa0 Over the same period, exports constitute around ~52% of total sales. The company exports both APIs and formulations to more than 170-180 countries including advanced regions such as the US and Europe. The company derives 34% of its export revenues from North and Latin America followed by 33% from Africa, 14% from Europe, 13% from Australasia and 6% from the Middle East.\xa0 It has filed seven ANDAs with the USFDA taking total filings to 171 ANDAs and received approval for two ANDAs taking total approved ANDAs to 90. Of these 90 approved, the company has currently commercialized only 40 products through partners. It is looking to re-launch the returned products from partners in Q4FY15 under its own brand name.\xa0 The company has bagged tenders worth ZAR 300mn in South Africa in the areas of respiratory, CVS, and women's health. It has launched Ipratropium MDI inhaler (market size USD 15 mn) in UK market and Mometasone nasal spray in the Netherlands during Q1FY15. The company expects to launch some combination inhalers including Symbicort in the EU market by the end of FY15. Management expects sales growth in mid-teens coupled with EBIDTA margins of 20-21% in FY15 on the back of global launches, steady growth in domestic formulations and eventbased opportunities in US generics. Capex will be at Rs 500 crore and R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of 5-6% in FY15. Baraclude API will be an important product for Cipla and it could be launched this year, while Xopenex will be launched fairly soon.The company seems to be more confident and assured in-spite of the fact that it has witnessed lowest margin in the last many quarters as the so-called investment cycle reaches the halfway mark process.

On a Y-o-Y basis the Q1 performance was weaker mainly because of a high base and the rationalisation process that is being implemented in different regions. Excluding the one-offs, the underlying sales growth stood near 15% during the quarter.

EBITDA margins declined 754 bps YoY to 19.9% but higher than Idirect estimate of 17.0% due to higher than anticipated improvement in gross profit margins. The dip in margins on a YoY basis was due to (i) increase in R&D cost and (ii) consolidation of low Cipla Medpro business. EBITDA on absolute basis declined 21% to Rs 541.8 crore (I-direct estimate: Rs478 crore). Spike in the depreciation and higher losses at the associate level led to net profit de-growth of 39% to Rs 294.6 crore (I-direct estimate: Rs 285.5 crore).Formulation exports constitute 49% of total revenues. To improve the quality of exports, Cipla has undertaken scores of measures, of late. Partnership deals and participation in global tenders were the growth drivers in the past for exports. The focus has now shifted to front-end model, especially for the US and a gradual shift from loss making HIV and other tenders to more lucrative respiratory and other opportunities in the US and EU. Recent acquisitions in Africa and other geographies is testimony to this transformation. We expect export sales to grow at a CAGR of 20% to Rs 7144 crore during FY14-16E. Key drivers will be 1) launch of combination inhalers in EU markets, 2) incremental product launches by its partners and increase in own product filings in the US, 3) reduced focus on the ARV tender business and at the same time increased focus on PEPFAR like tenders and 4) Medpro consolidation.Going by the Q1FY15 numbers, the company seems to be on track to achieve the 20-21% EBITDA margin guidance. Though it is pretty early to confirm a full circle of successful transformation, it seems that things may have started working, at least on the margins front. However, that may take some toll on topline growth, which was visible during the quarter as exports growth was below estimates. Assuming a three to five year gestation period from FY11, the year in which the whole exercise was initiated, we expect the recovery process to continue slowly but surely.

This is the first combination inhaler launch by Cipla in European countries. According to company press release, Cipla will be launching the drug in other European countries over next 12-18 months. Although market size of Advair MDI in Germany and Sweden is small (~USD40mn), overall market for Advair MDI in Europe is ~USD800mn. The launch establishes Cipla as the front runner in combination MDIs as no other generic company has received approval in this category so far. According to Cipla management (based on 3QFY15 call) generic Advair MDI in Europe is likely to be a substitutable version.Going forward we are expecting Cipla will be able to launch the drug in UK, which is the largest market of Advair MDI (~USD400mn) in Europe. As the product is likely to be a substitutable version of GSKs Advair, ramp up of the product should happen very fast. Competition should also remain very limited as only Mylan seems to be the other company developing generic version of Advair MDI and is expecting approval in 1HCY15. With 50% generic penetration, 40% price erosion and 25% market share, we believe this can add ~USD120mn to Cipla topline in FY16E with very high margin (~50-60% EBITDA).As the inhaler opportunity starts unfolding companys business outlook in regulated countries (Europe and US) now looks brighter. We believe, Cipla will be able to launch generic version of Symbicort MDI and Advair Diskus in US over the next 4-5 years. Apart from Inhalers in Europe, US sales of the company should also grow significantly over the next couple of years driven by niche launches like gBaraclude, gXopenex and gNasonex.

Even today 99 per cent of all the drugs inventedin the globe take place in developed markets,Hamiedsaid.I had told the Indian Government to give us time.', 'By about 2025, I feel India would be on technological parity with the developed countries and then we ourselves wouldve said that we are ready to take them on.As a scientist, I firmly believe that innovation must be rewarded. However, I have always been against monopoly as it leads to high prices.Here in India, we need free prices, not monopoly,Hamiedsaid.Hamieds call for a re-look at existing regulations in the pharmaceutical sector have been echoed by otherbiotechnologymajors in the country, as well.On Friday,Biocontoo accused Switzerland-basedRocheof trying to create a monopoly situation for its own trastuzumab, used for the treatment of HER-2 positive breast cancer.Rochesecured an injunction against Indias largest publicly-heldbiotechnologycompany, Biocon, preventing it from claiming its newdrugis a biosimilar of the Swissdruggiants innovator drug,Herceptin.BioconsdrugCanmab, jointly developed withMylanis priced at a 25-30 per cent discount to the new price of RochesHerceptinwhich in turn was slashed by half in anticipation of the biosimilars that hit the market early this year.A new debate is also emerging on the stringent guidelines makingclinical trialsmore strictly regulated in the country.India is the worlds largest generic drugmaker and leading exporter of these product versions that are priced at much lower rates than the innovatiordrugand hence more affordable in emerging markets.However, an amendment passed by the Indian Government in March 2005 reintroduced the patent system and as a result, domesticdrugmakers have been prevented from replicating patented drugs invented after the year 1995.While the law found much favour with the international community, domesticdrugmakers were restrained from manufacturing generic drugs - a provision they enjoyed from 1972 until the 2005 amendment.That was selective genocide. The impact of what the Government did in 2005 will be felt by 2015,Hamiedsaid sounding a note of caution.India requires a simple, pragmatic licensing policy that ensures that vital, life-saving drugs are available at affordable prices in future and none are denied medication,Hamiedsaid.This, to me, is a basic human right, he told reporters at the launch of the an education programme to promote the study of chemistry in the country.Hamiedhas contributed Rs 8 crore to support a programme organised by the Royal Society of Chemistry, a non-profit organisation promoting chemistry education.']"

These are medicines that are available with multinational corporations (MNCs) but are too expensive for the poor. Taking advantage of the loophole in the Indian patent law of 1970,Cipladecided to take on the world\'s most powerful corporations by copying theanti-AIDS drugsand selling it dirt cheap to the poor by 2001. The global media soon portrayed Hamied as a modern-day Robin Hood but was predictably called a ""pirate"" by theMNCs.TheMNCssoon hit back with multiple law suits in India and abroad. They argue that they spent billions of dollars to research and invent a drug, so they should be allowed to get reasonable returns.Hamied argues the inventor of a drug is hardly paid well and the multinationals buy the inventions for a few millions of dollars but make billions from it. He says as Indian law provides (as it did before amended in the early 2000s) for copying the formula, he did not break any law while providing medicines at cheaper rates.How it startedIt was during the early 2000, when Hamied - who joined the company as a young scientist - shot to fame when he told a European Commission meeting at Brussels that he could sell a three-drug anti-retroviral combination for the treatment of AIDS for $800 per patient a year. This enraged theMNCswho were selling the same combination for $12,000 per patient a year. This was at the peak of the AIDS epidemic and millions of poor Africans were dying for lack of affordable medicine.Poor African countries, who were big consumers of this medicine welcomed theCiplaoffer.Ciplamade an entry into the market with a bang and soon dropped prices to less than a dollar per patient a day.As the global media took notice of Hamied,Ciplawas inundated with orders.MNCsstarted losing the global public relations war. They also reduced their prices for AIDS drug but were no match forCipla.', 'Indiancompaniescan now break patents - only in a national emergency. Hamied says every country\'s patent laws should be need-based to that country and should be national laws not international ones.Hamied thinks that in its fight against MNCs, the industry is not getting the required support from the government. ""What I am against is the monopoly we are offering to multinationals in India. When the US was facing anthrax and the bird flu crisis, it was ready to break any patents. That was in its national interest. The innovator should get a fair return of, say, royalty of four per cent of net sales. India is in a perennial heath crisis. The largest numbers of AIDS patients, diabetes, TB, malaria are in India. Our policies should be suitable for Indians and Indiancompaniesshould have the automatic right to break patents in case of a national emergency,"" Hamied said in an earlier interview with this newspaper.Hamied says India should have a new health policy that should favour Indians and not multinationals. ""Look at China. The country is doing everything possible which is in the interest of the Chinese, whether on patents or setting up plants in China. But just look at any Indian government hospital and you can see what kind of health care Indians are getting. A benevolent dictatorship is better than our kind of democracy, he said.Cipla, meanwhile, is also investing in its own research. ""We are investing close to five per cent of net sales in research on new drugs and have received patents on incremental innovations like Dymist, a spray to treat nasal congestion. We are actively working on nano particles, which will bring down the cost ofanti-AIDS drugssubstantially. If we are ready to pay royalty to the innovator, we should be allowed to make the drug to help the poor in India - for example an anti-TB drug,"" he says. The patent for an anti-TB drug is with a multinational and this is where Hamied thinks India should help its citizens by allowing localcompaniesto make the medicine.Ciplaalso buyingcompaniesabroad to make its distribution base stronger. It took over South Africa-based Medpro for $512 million, bought a Yemeni company in July this year for $21 million and a drug distributor in Sri Lanka. The idea is to make sure that the company\'s made-in-India drugs reach every part of the world.Ciplaaims to earn 70 per cent of its revenues from abroad from the present 60 per cent.Clearly,Ciplais re-writing its own history by taking its patent war to the multinationals\' camp.']"

The stock has, thus, been flat since the announcement of the order on December 23.While the recent order and the prospects for the company in the developed markets are sound, the Street is worried about near-term earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortisation (Ebitda) margins, which have been on a continuous decline over the past few quarters. The Ebitda margins at 20.2 per cent in the September 2014 quarter had come 124 basis points lower year-on-year.', 'The lower margins are, however, understandable given the company is setting up its own front-end in countries such as South Africa, leading to higher expenses initially. This will, however, lead to margin improvement later.The high returns for the stock (45 per cent) over the past six months have been driven by strong growth in the domestic business, which contributes half of Ciplas current revenues. Also, the respiratory segment (its inhalation range especially combination inhalers) is expected to become a large contributor in coming days as approvals start flowing. In fact, it is the only generic company to launch Advair-metered dose inhalers in the UK during FY15, which has led to Hitesh Mahida of Antique Stock Broking to upgrade his FY16 estimated earnings by 10 per cent.Ciplaremains one of the few companies along with the likes of Sun and Lupin that will benefit from the current strengthening of dollar. Of overall revenues, 39.5 per cent are in dollar terms, 6.2 per cent in euro, 12.3 per cent in rand and the remaining in rupees.The trigger for the stock that trades at Rs 622.65 levels is the sales momentum from the respiratory segment. Mahida allocates Rs 66 a share to future combination inhaler launches, which accounts for 11 per cent in sum-of-the-parts valuation.']"

Last month, the company had won a global tender worth $189 million to supply antiretroviral orAIDS drugs.Given upsides from its inhaler portfolio, revenue growth from niche products, new markets, joint ventures and alliances, analysts believe there are upsides to the stock in the medium to long term.The recent trigger was Ciplas outperformance in the domestic market in February, registering a 24 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) growth, the highest among the countrys top 10 pharma companies. The pharma sector, too, grew at 18.9 per cent y-o-y.

The management guidance seems conservative given upside in the supply of Nexium (antacid) generic and new tenders rolling out in emerging markets. The management had guided for a 9-10 per cent growth in revenues and an OPM of over 20 per cent in the current financial year, while FY16 is expected to see growth in mid teens and an improvement in the OPM.While the firm has been looking at growth on the basis of tie-ups and acquisitions, they have been small so far and what could give kicker to the stock is a larger acquisition in the US.

However, analysts maintain a cautious stance on the stock, given a conservative growth forecast by the management. The company has said it expects 100-150 bps improvement in margins and sales growth in the mid-teens, which analysts say are on the lower side.Growth in the domestic market, which contributes 36 per cent to sales, at 20.7 per cent, has outperformed the domestic sector growth of 12 per cent. The respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and anti-infective portfolio continues to do well and momentum is expected to continue.Exports grew 25 per cent, with the strategy of having own front-end operations yielding results. However, this has a bearing on margins, given the higher fixed costs. Nevertheless, in this backdrop and also the fact there were no one-off benefits seen a year ago (supply of Dymista nasal spray), margin improvement by about 30 bps to 16.4 per cent is positive. In store are benefits from supply of gastric drug Nexium to Teva, both on revenue and margins, starting in the current (June) quarter. With other contenders for generic launch of Nexium are unlikely to get approvals or launch before the second half of FY16, Cipla is likely to reap the benefits for at least one quarter.Analysts still see the benefits on margins to be partly offset by increased costs.', 'Analysts at HSBC believe Cipla remains conservative, as they forecast higher sales growth and build in continued higher expenses, although staff costs are expected to moderate. On margins, analysts indicate 200 basis points improvement in FY16.The respiratory opportunities, especially for the US, will depend on approvals and might not come soon, though some analysts expect faster approvals. Europe is unfolding well and approval of generic Seretide inhaler in the UK is a big catalyst in the near medium term, feel analysts.

Its not clear whether the agreement has been signed or not.The family is also signing a pre-emptive rights agreement that would give rights to Yusuf Hamied or his representatives to buy out others, if need be. The plan was activated in October last year when the Hamieds approached the market regulator, Sebi, seeking its informal guidance on the entire transaction process and exemption from making an open offer.Sebi granted the exemption in February this year but made it public after the family sought time to keep the matter confidential for 90 days.Interestingly, in February this year, Cyrus Poonawalla of Pune-based Serum Institute admitted to early merger talks with Cipla. This was rejected by a promoter family member to this newspaper, saying both companies are too big for a merger.GROWTH PILL']"
