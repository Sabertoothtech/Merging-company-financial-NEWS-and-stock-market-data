However, its asset quality may continue to be weak this quarter.The bank's business growth for the quarter may be below industry rate. Its deposits are expected to grow 10-12% y-o-y, while its loan book is expected to grow by 12-14% during the same period. Major credit growth on the domestic operations would be primarily from retail, SME and agri divisions as corporate loan segment is expected to remain muted.Bank of Baroda stands out amongst otherpublic sector banksdue to better asset quality. In addition, the bank's overseas operation has supported its overall business growth. As a result, it is one of the few public sector banks which is expected to maintain its profits in the march quarter. On the other hand, its peers such as SBI andPunjab National Bankare expected to show a de-growth this quarter.The Bank's asset quality would be the key point to watch out for in this quarter's results. With fresh slippages, the bank is expected to report a marginal increase in gross non-performing assets in this quarter. As of December 2013, gross non-performing assets constituted 3.19% of the total assets. Any substantial increase this quarter is likely to put pressure on the bank's stock post the results.""]"

The bank's 15% y-o-y increase innet interest income(NII) helped BoB's growth, beating most of itsPSUpeers. The net interest margin (NIM) from its domestic and international businesses improved by 10 basis points each on a quarter-overquarter basis.Despite the tough economic conditions, Bank of Baroda managed to show a loan book growth of 19% y-o-y, primarily because of the pick-up in SME lending. It boasts 22% credit growth for the past five years. Though the growth rate may not remain at this level in the coming quarters, it is expected to outpace the industry growth rate. With around 30% of its branches in Gujarat and Maharashtra, the states that have high industrial activity, the bank is an ideal candidate for playing the expected industrial revival.Bank of Baroda's asset quality remained at comfortable levels and its netnon-performing assets(NPA) declined by Rs 14 crore q-o-q. Though there was a rise in fresh slippages last quarter, it was offset by increased recoveries. With just 2.5% of laggedloans, Bank of Baroda still remains one of the best banks among PSU peers. Its management continues to retain conservative policies. For example, the ` 320 crore markto-market gain the bank booked during the quarter was utilised for making ad hoc bad debt provisions. A well diversified loan bookoverseas (32%), SME (22%), retail (17%), agriculture (12%), corporate and others (34%)is the primary factor helping the bank maintain its asset quality. Though increased slippages may continue for a few more quarters, the situation is expected to improve later because of the overall improvement at the macroeconomic level.Though Bank of Baroda is trading at a premium compared to some its PSU peers, analysts feel it is justified. This is so because its return ratios (return on assets at 0.8% and return on equity at 15%) are better compared with its peers. Investors were concerned about the low tax outflow of 18% in the fourth quarter of 2013-14. However, it has normalised at 30% in the first quarter of 2014-15. Despite this, the bank reported a net profit growth of 17% y-o-y.Selection methodology: We choose the stock that has shown the maximum increase in consensus analyst rating during the last one month. Consensus rating is arrived at by averaging all analyst recommendations after attributing weights to each of them (5 for strong buy, 4 for buy, 3 for hold, 2 for sell and 1 for strong sell). Any improvement in consensus analyst rating indicates that analysts are getting more bullish on the stock. To make sure that we pick only companies with decent analyst coverage, this search will be restricted to stocks with at least 10 analysts covering it. You can see similar consensus analyst rating changes during the last one week in ETW 50 table.""]"

Excerpts:ET Now: Start off with the charts. Though it was 7,913 on Friday's close, can we do more next week itself?Mitesh Thacker:We should extend this up move. The important thing is that why the last few days have seen some kind of subdued and a very slow up move, nevertheless the index has continued to make newer highs. So a trend remains on the upside. We have seen the Bank Nifty finally have a daily as well as weekly closing above levels of 15,550-15,600. Both these events are important.My only worry is that a couple of bigger index names, stocks like ITC, HUL, Reliance, some of the private sector banks, are not really participating. That is why there is some lack of momentum in the Nifty, but again considering the fact that we are on all-time highs, the important thing here would be to identify a level below which there could be some kind of profit booking happening. So the last breakout happened at 7835. Now unless until that level is broken, I would maintain a positive bias.The missing piece in this entire jigsaw could be the fact that there is no momentum at higher levels, but that could happen if all these stocks which I mentioned start to participate. So once we get past 7950 and you see some kind of participation happening from the index heavyweights, maybe the momentum will come back. So these are two levels which we will be observing. The bias is on the long side, trail your stop losses 7835 and maybe beyond 7950 this could pick up as well.ET Now: What about the one getting ousted then United Spirits even though it sort of bounced back in Friday's session, the oblique picture ahead?Mitesh Thacker:Yes, looks like that. The stock clearly was getting into some kind of an uptrend. If you look at the price movement on Tuesday, Wednesday, that has kind of given that trend up.While it has managed to hold on to the recent lows of 2290, we have seen a double bottom formation around those areas. So until that is broken, you might not see much downside, but the upside case has been dissolved for the time being. So it might do some kind of range-bound activity between 2450 and 2460 on the upside to roughly about 2300-2290 on the downside.ET Now: I want to come to you on two names - Titan and Marico Kaya, I do not know though if you looked at the charts of Marico Kaya at all.Mitesh Thacker:No, Marico Kaya is something unfortunately I am not tracking, but Titan definitely is interesting, had a very strong breakout on Thursday, and Friday was more of a pullback kind of day.It still remains above the breakout levels of 359-360 and this decline can be used to buy into the stock. Eventually, the stock will head towards 395-400 and anywhere between 360 and 365 would be good areas to accumulate the stock slowly. Keep the stop below 354 and look for the target of around 395.ET Now: PSU banks did not get this chance to talk about that, CLSA upgrade as well coming in, it is to how there could be some improvement from here onwards in terms of macros as well as the policy environment now improving, what is the sense that you are getting, any good longs are there?Mitesh Thacker:See, the CNX PSU banking index appreciate by about 7% for the week. So individually stocks have done very well. If you just talk of the CNX PSU banking index for a moment, 3660 is some kind of supply zone. We will just had a high of around 3657 for Friday, but eventually the pattern suggests that the bottom has been made and we will see further upside. The stocks which I like over here are Union Bank, Bank of India,Bank of Baroda,Punjab National BankandState Bank of India.So that practically covers the liquid large cap space. I do like the midcap stocks like Allahabad Bank, but there I would wait for a breakout above 127. Most of the stocks we have been having trading calls and again on any 2%, 3%, 4% kind of decline, if it happens on Monday or Tuesday, we would be looking at possibly adding on to long positions.ET Now: IT as a pack held out quite well and Friday gave a very spectacular move with the CNX IT index closing in at record highs. What is the sense that you are getting about the IT pack, further headroom in-store or come Monday and one would see profit taking?Mitesh Thacker:On the charts, there is some loss of momentum but there is no sense of the direction reversing as yet. So I would be slightly cautious, but there could be some kind of upside happening in a few of IT names.We had calls onTech Mahindra, last week it did extremely well. The next stock which could be interesting to watch would be HCL Tech once it starts getting past 1615. Once that happens, that opens more upside to about 1660, possibly 1680 on the upside.The other one which I like isWipro. It has not really participated. It has been kind of underperforming but had a mild breakout towards the end of Friday's session.After the result, there was a big price gap down. So that will act as a supply zone, but it can eventually see the pre-result levels of 580-585 in the short term.ET Now: What are your trading calls for Monday morning?Mitesh Thacker:See I would recommend a buy onSPARC(Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company) now. I have been recommending this stock earlier as well, but it has done two things - one, it has closed at an all-time high level; secondly, it has managed with that it has given a breakout above the earlier swing highs of 185-186.So keeping a stop loss below 183, I would suggest buying SPARC for targets of around 210. The other stock which I like is a PSU banking stock -- Bank of Baroda. That is a buy with a stop below 899, for targets of around 955 to begin with.""]"

Clearly from a valuation perspective they are trading at very attractive valuations. So clearly within the lot itself Bank of India is still what we like.Bank of Barodaas Nikunj was mentioning has done the right things. The capital adequacy ratios are right, the NIMs have been maintained and clearly they are on the thrust with branch expansion to kick in the operatingleveragebenefits that the bank can derive from. So Bank of Baroda also remains one of our preferred picks withState Bank of Indiawithin the PSU lot. Yes, it trades at apremiumto the other smaller PSU banks but again that premium is justified considering the kind of asset quality that the bank has indicated. So one needs to be stock specific within the PSU space. When it comes specifically to NBFCs, we have been liking NBFCs for some amount of time to come and again our view is thatLIC Housing Finance, IndiabullsHousing Financeare very attractively placed not just that the real estate sector will zoom off from the current levels but the kind of advances that they and the kind of asset quality that these guys have maintained they are looking attractive as well.']"

This is not unique to India. Across the globe, we are seeing that the pace of structural reforms is always painfully slow and by the time this would have impact on the actual ground it takes anywhere between 8 months to 12 months. But having said that, the recent setback to India has come in the form of contracting exports. Even if our inflation has been declining sequentially, inflation differential between India and its trading partners continues to remain high, and when the economy picks up, non-oil, non-gold imports also start picking up and that growth is observed to be quite strong for the last couple of months, which is putting pressure on CAD.

So I guess yes this is an opportunity and if you are bullish at 8500 or 8600 on the long term economic growth and equity markets giving you good returns I do not see no reason why at current levels on the Nifty spot orSensexspot you should have any negative ideas from a long term investment horizon.So, yes to answer your question on the banking pack and given the fact that on 2nd of December it was the first time that the RBI Governor was so vocal enough to actually lay down the time frame in terms of rate cut coming through and that is going to be early part of 2015.According to our assumptions the interest rate cut it is going to be anywhere between January to February possibly that the first rate cut will come through and of course that is not the only platform where the RBI Governor has to deliver the rate cut.Intermediate in case if the data points are positive and supportive then you might even hear a rate cut earlier coming in from the RBI Governor.So there are very few selective stocks that we cover in our banking universe as far as PSU banks are concernedState Bank of IndiaandBank of Barodaare the two names where we are holding out our extremely positive view. We are more biased towards the private sector banks yes we would give more weightage to buying into current correction into the private sector banks and your question whether for the next two or three months it is going to be a bet even longer if you look at the rate cut scenario coming through you look at the economic growth loan book growing and retail participation growing.Not only three months even longer if you want to play the banking pack, it is going to be one particular sector that is going to be supporting the economic recovery that we are talking about.']"

""There is a suspected fraud. An internal probe is on. If the money cannot be recovered, the bank will have to take a hit... An established company is involved, but I\'m not in a position to disclose the name... We sensed something was wrong when a few bills bounced,"" said the person who declined to share details as an investigation is underway.It is understood that one of the bank\'s offices in Ahmedabad ended up discounting bills against which the underlying trade transactions were fake or non-existent.In typical bill discounting transactions, a bank buys the bill before it is due and credits the amount (after deducting certain discounting charge) to the customer\'s account. It\'s a facility that sellers and exporters avail of from banks to obtain finance. A fraud is perpetrated when typically a buyer and seller, acting in connivance, win the bank\'s confidence by carrying out a string of regular transactions where the buyer (either local or overseas) agrees to honour the payment. As these come across as normal trade transactions, the bank agrees to raise the bill discounting limit. After a default  when a buyer fails to pay up  the seller comes up with explanations like product defect or cash crunch faced by the buyer for non-payment.Once the bank is convinced, the seller makes a new shipment, discounts a new bill and uses the proceeds to repay the bank for the previous transaction. As this is repeated for a few more shipments, the amount increases due to the interest cost.While the specific modus operandi in the Bank of Baroda fraud is still unclear, it is possible that the customer concerned  which, according to a banker in Ahmedabad, is a textile company  had used a similar ploy.Such frauds surface as increasingly larger amounts and frequent discounting evoke the bank\'s suspicion.In recent times, the facilities offered by many banks for working capital have increasingly been misused by borrowers facing cash flow stress  in particular, the trade bills discounting facilities offered by banks has been a source of frequent \'kite flying\' (without actual trade transactions) for funds generation by borrowers.""At some point when the amount becomes too large to handle, the parties abruptly discontinue. Since in several cases, these are in the nature of unsecured finance, a bank may be left with no choice but to absorb the losses,"" said another banker.']"

Between August 1, 2014 and August 12 this year, there were 8,667 forex transactions from the branch, prompting the bank to probe the matter.Investigations showed major irregularities as the forex transactions were done mainly through advance remittances for import through newly-opened current accounts; heavy cash transactions were also noticed  sometimes four to five times a day.Interestingly, theincome taxdepartment and other agencies were oblivious of the transactions despite amounts transferred adding up to several crores a day. BoB\'s internal audit team recently red-flagged the irregularities to the finance ministry. It is not known yet whether this money belonged to an entity which wanted its black money sent outside India or a group of people. Central agencies like CBI and ED are likely to soon investigate the matter, said sources.An internal investigation by the bank revealed that the transactions did not trigger alerts such as generation of exceptional transaction report by the branch in North Delhi.Repeated attempts to reach BoB executive director B B Joshi did not yield any result.The revelation comes at a time when theNarendra Modigovernment is trying to ensure that black money does not flow abroad and some of it parked overseas actually comes back.Congress alleged that the amount, made up of ""black money"", was sent out of the country through a series of bank transaction two months after the NDA government took charge at the Centre last year. ""Leave alone Vyapam,Lalit Modior theChhattisgarhrice scam, I want to tell the PM that this scam is happening in Delhi right under the nose of the Centre,"" Congress spokesperson R P N Singh said.Congress spokesperson Singh said for past two days inBihar, the PM has been saying that there has been no scam since his government took over and the same thing he repeated from the Red Fort and in his speeches abroad.Demanding an independent probe into the matter, he said, ""The bank is in Delhi and the government has all the information about the scam as the audit report was sent to higher authorities. BJP has been talking about scandals. So many scams are coming out, but the PM says that there is not even one allegation against him.

There were heavy cash receipts also in newly opened accounts of some importers.The investigation report accessed by TOI adds that the amount was remitted as advance for imports and in most of the cases, the beneficiary was the same (such as Victroxx International Ltd, Great Asian Exports, King Winner International Ltd, Star Exim Ltd, ItouchInfocomm Ltd, Fortune Trading Pvt Ltd, Jasco Ltd, Mega Forwarders and Traders etc).The amount remitted in all the transactions was less than $100,000. The remittances in all cases were made to Hong Kong, said the report.""It was observed that on many occasions, the party made 4/5 remittances in a single day to the same exporter and the total amount of all the remittances was more than $100,000. 4-5 remittances were probably done to keep the amount of each remittance less than $100,000,"" adds the report.Explaining the modus operandi, in which Bank of Baroda officials are said to be involved, the report states that the branch was in practice of consolidated reporting of forex transactions against large number of public bills. Docket numbers were not obtained/generated for each remittance and inspite of heavy advance payment for imports being made to the same suppliers, credit reports of the suppliers were not obtained. And wherever credit reports are available with the branch, the same contained adverse remarks. ""The branch has not adhered to due diligence while remitting advance payment for imports,"" says the report.Subsequently, A-1 form in most of the cases was not signed by the branch head/bank official and in many cases by the customer.It adds that ""in most of the cases mode of shipment, date of shipment and place of shipmen are not mentioned in the proforma invoice"" and ""bill of entry/evidence of imports was not obtained before making further remittances to the same supplier"".

No one owned the money but fading trails led to a top UP politician.Investigations revealed the CP vault's owner had deposited at least Rs 1,000 crore in cash in the central Delhi branches of three leading private banks in the space of nine months and remitted the same to Dubai by producing fake customs invoices of diamond imports. Diamonds were, however, never actually imported or sold in Surat and Mumbai, as the trader had claimed.The vault owner's only job was to provide safe locker services to big industrialists and politicians who had huge cash, launder them to Dubai in the garb of diamond imports and thereafter the beneficiaries invested the money in properties in third country or even brought it back to India as legal currency by way of foreign direct investments (FDIs).All this was done through the banking channel. The leading private banks allowed huge cash deposits without alerting the financial intelligence agencies. Even when the racket was unearthed, authorities ensured no actions were taken against any banks.As per rules, any bank branch caught aiding money laundering can face punitive actions that may include closure of the branch in question, besides heavy monetary penalty. None of these conditions were, however, imposed on banks who allegedly broke these rules even four years after the incident. Such cases have been put in cold storage, or probably closed.Many in the investigative agencies call this legal hawalamoney laundering using the banking channel. The recent case of Bank of Baroda in Ashok Vihar and the Oriental Bank of Commerce in Ghaziabad where fake customs invoices were generated and remittances to the tune of over Rs 6,000 crore made to Hong Kong and from there to Dubai fall in this category.This legal hawala has been going on for decades despite the fact that agencies such as the directorate of revenue intelligence, the ED, the income tax and the financial intelligence unit have generated several alerts by way of concrete investigation reports and suspicious transaction details.The investigation into the former Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda case in 2010 revealed a bigger scam at the Noida Special Economic Zone (NSEZ) where sleuths detected fictitious trade in gold and diamonds.Agencies had then found that the Noida SEZ had a turnover of around Rs 16,000 crore of which nearly Rs 10,000 crore was trade in gold, platinum and diamonds, most of which had allegedly been imported from Dubai and re-exported to Dubai.Intelligence officials probing the Koda case believed most of these trades were made only on paper to facilitate banking transactions and launder money to Dubai from where it was routed to a third country. Three such companies, which were barred from operating in bullion trade from the SEZ on suspicion of money laundering, were allegedly found linked to henchmen of Madhu Koda.One of Koda's aides, a Mumbai-based diamond merchant, was found to have deposited huge cash in Noida-based banks and remitted them to Dubai in the garb of gold and diamond imports.""]"

In an interaction withET, Jayakumar underplayed his role in the clean-up, and instead emphasised what lies ahead. Edited excerpts:You have reported a historic loss with a huge share of bad loans. Why are you taking the hit in one go?Whether you take the hit in one quarter or spread it over two, the outcome is the same. In this way, we have put the uncertainty behind us. As far as we can see, we have taken whatever was required as provisions.What does one expect from the bank in the next quarter?Going ahead, we only expect normal slippages, which are not going to be significant, and we expect a fair degree of stability.What's the fresh capital requirement now?We are telling our shareholders not to worry about unlimited dilution. As far as we are concerned, the bank does not need any fresh capital. We have even told the government that it can be taken off any list that discusses fresh capital infusion. As an institution, we are very comfortable and quite capable of supporting the growth of our customers. Tomorrow, if the price goes up twice or 3 times our book value, then we will raise capital. Our analysis shows that part of the reason why stocks of public sector banks have suffered is the fear of unlimited dilution.What kind of credit growth would you be able to support?I am visualising a 20% growth rate, which I think is fairly a strong position to take. I can support a 20% growth rate without taking into account any profit that may come from the next quarter or the next whole year, and selling only part of the financial assets that we own.How would you go ahead with funding projects with so much stress in the economy?The decision to fund is not related to a project's NPA status. What we are talking about is real assets, which are stuck there and a lot of money has already been invested. We know what's right for our customers will also be right for us. We have an extremely granular exposure  not more than Rs 2,000 crore in any one company.Since you are not seeking capital, are there any specific demands you are making to the government?We have asked the government for long-term compensation with respect to stock option plans for senior employees. The board has approved it today (Saturday) and we will submit it in a week's time.Should the bold move to clean up books, even if it means a historic loss, be credited to the fact that you have worked with Citibank earlier?I am not saying that I'm a hero, and I have come from the private sector and have fixed everything, and should now get aPadma Shri.

Besides flushing out all the NPAs, BOB has also announced slew of measures to take the growth forward. In an interview to ET Now, PS Jayakumar, Bank of Baroda MD, said that worst is behind and BOB is taking necessary measures to prevent further deterioration of assets. He put the net worth of NPAs around Rs 38,000 crore. He was hopeful about BOB getting back to 14-15% return on equity over next 2 years. Edited excerpts:ET Now: What is going to be BOB's next step?PS Jayakumar:It is back to usual. Banking business is built up loan by loan, deposit by deposit. We will be focused and keep going forward. There are lot of things to do in bringing different products, improving existing product sets. Lot of work has to be done in the area of technology to reach the current level and preferably leapfrog existing technology and service providers. There is a lot of work that we need to do in corporate lending, Rebalancing portfolio, being more specific about the target market of customers we need to reach out. There are certain inefficiencies in our balance sheet which we need to address. Some work will happen early, some will happen late, some will take more time, but the important thing is to stay focused and get it done. So for us it is all about execution.ET Now: Can you explain the calculation behind book value?PS Jayakumar:We have a slippage of about 15,000 odd crores happening in this quarter. Certain portion of it had happened because of theAQRreview of theReserve Bank of Indiawhich contributed a little over 7000 crores. These are accounts or customers who are paying perfectly on our book but are probably havingstresswith other banks. These provisions could have happened in subsequent quarters or next year. So that having being identified, certain amount of pressure is off as we have identified proactively certain stress that might be in the book. Second, we also did a full review of our existing portfolio to see potential places which should have been accounted but may not have been accounted for variety of reasons. We have substantially completed that exercise. We had little over 3000 crores moving into NPA. We also have some restructured account amount moving into NPA and the balance 3000 odd crores was slippages from what are called SMA-2. In our overall provision, real assets and plants machineries constitute around 53-54%. We think the extent of provision we have taken at this point of time is reasonably adequate. So the overall provision of somewhere around 6,400 crores was taken and with that we think the book is currently rightly valued. Therefore, the book value comes from there and that is really what it is. The important thing is to do our best to make sure that that all NPA accounts are actually reflected as such and provisioning for those accounts are made accordingly.ET Now: What is the current book value of BOB?PS Jayakumar:The net worth of the company after adjustment is really the book value at this point of time that is how you should look at it. This is the end of the NPA problems and We cannot give a deterministic position on it, but it is a range of probability. There could be a scenario whereeconomyis doing well or the opposite. Also, there could be a set of intermediary position between the two. When we look at capital and net worth, we look at the worst position. What can go wrong from here and how worse it can get. Our analysis suggest that if the economic outcomes are not good next year, we still think that company has enough earnings power to pay for additional provisioning. Keeping this in mind, it is reasonable to conclude that the reflected net worth of the company would be the book value of the company.ET Now: Do you think that the economic situation could go worse from here and there would be a rise in NPAs as well?PS Jayakumar: I am not saying it is going to happen this way or that way. As an institution, we have to take into account a range of situations we may have to face. Then we need to ask whether our shareholders, customers, deposit holders are adequately protected. So let us take the most negative outcome and see whether we have enough earning flow to stay protected as far as the NPA is concerned. Therefore, the broad point is further dilution of equity capital on current NPA and provision requirement should not happen. Do we want the worst outcome to come? Absolutely not. Do we see it happening? Does not look like. But in any case, you have to plan for contingencies accordingly.ET Now: Do you think in worst case scenario NPAs slippages would revert back to the level of Rs 5000-7000 crores in the quarters ahead?PS Jayakumar: Slippages of a substantial nature on account of lumpy accounts are not likely to happen. We do not see that happening, but we do have some amount of exposure on account of the SME too. We have factored all of that into account while looking at the next year's projection. We are hoping that we will stay at the current level but we cannot rule out deterioration of some assets. But, even in that case we have a set of plans to address and ensure that we are adequately protected and have enough capital to grow. For today we have adequate provision and we have declared all that is in NPS and NPA. Can there be additional flows? I do not see that happening from large accounts. The AQR to some extent is a reflection of that so they have been brought forward so it is there. On the retail side, deteriorations can happen but I really do not worry about it because we are reasonably well collateralized and historical loss rates in mortgage industry on a life time basis have been practically next to nothing. Therefore, our focus is to actively prevent and mitigate further deterioration of our portfolio.ET Now: So what is your current book value?PS Jayakumar:It must be theoretically the net worth of the company. It would around 40000 crores and with the adjustment of 3000 crores, 37000 would be the book value of the firm.ET Now: Your loans are collateralized by assets, so you have some underlying assets. Assuming that economic recovery is round the corner, how far are you away from asset recovery and bad loans becoming good loans cycle?PS Jayakumar:Approximately we have 38000 crores of assets that are in the NPA category. On those assets on an average we provide 40% by way of provisioning. So if we set aside Rs 5000 crores and get a flow back, the recovery on that would adequately protect from further deterioration of assets.Secondly, we have restructured assets worth around 17000 crores, out of which 3300 crores for various discom companies. We think the worst case is Rs 8000 crore flow from the restructured account.So you take that forward you have some number of provisioning that has to be taken unaccounted. If we take a number of 30% that adds up to about 2400 crores. Next, we have the balance of SME too and it is unreasonable to believe none of them will flow. There will be pluses and minuses but there could be net out flow. In 2014-15 our pre-tax, pre-provision revenue was around Rs 9800 crores. So we have that revenue generation capability. Assuming that we are doing all that we are planning to do in terms of improving the total quality of the earnings, we probably should be, a little bit further hopefully.We have a fair amount of assets which we can liquidate which we call as non-core. This does not include any investment in our subsidiaries orinsurancecompany. These areinvestmentsthat have been made over a period of time which do not carry anymore strategic value and the question is to exit and at the right value. Taking that into consideration, we are in a fairly comfortable position over all. That's the reason why we took a position and explained it. We see a return to 5% to 8% from 6 to 12% return on equity depending upon how the economic environment will eventually play out. Whatever be the economic environment, as we go from 2016-2017 to 2017-2018, we should get back to a reasonable level of return on equity which would be 14-15%. For equity holders, at this point of time, unlimited dilution and return to normality is what matters the most.""]"

Edited excerptsET Now: What is the impact of these newRBInorms on revaluation reserves? How much is added to the BOBtier 1 capital?VS Narang: Revaluation reserves as of now are being treated as a part of tier 2 capital and the impact of this will be that from tier 2 they become the part of CET 1 that is tier 1 capital and out of tier 1 also CET 1 capital. So it will be movement from tier 2 toCET1. So it is a positive impact because ultimately in CET 1 also we need to maintain. It is the core equity portion of the capital and BASEL 3 norms require the CET at a certain percentage of ratios to be maintained. The impact of capital as of now which is there on account of thestressin the books of the public sector banks is all on CET only, so to that extent it is positive and BOB also has certain amount of revaluation reserves under tier 2 capital which will move to tier 1 and CET 1.ET Now: What is the number? Your tier 1 capital is now about 9.04 per cent. How much will it be post the RBI revised norms?VS Narang:To the extent, if I see the revaluation reserves that alone is giving me something of the order of movement, it is a movement of around 10 bps from tier 2 to tier 1. But the impact of the other two sectors which have been allowed by the Reserve Bank of India that is the foreign currency translation reserves and treatment of the deferred tax assets, if I add both of these two, the combined impact of all three comes to around 64-65 bps.ET Now: What happens to your book value now? If tier 1 goes up, the book value calculation and assumptions will also change?VS Narang:The book value calculation also will change but I do not think it will have significant impact on the book value. Ultimately, it is the CET ratio which is more important and the impact will be on CET 1. So this 64 bps number I gave you was the overall impact. But CET alone will be increased by approximately 1 per cent. So CET gets increased but overall impact is around 60 bps odd. This is what it is for BOB.ET Now: Will it have a material impact on lending because the last time we spoke to Mr Jayakumar, he mentioned that BOB does not even need capital right now. It is sufficiently capitalised to lend if lending opportunities arise at all. So, while this is a good thing to happen for the future, does it have any immediate impact for BOB?VS Narang:As far as BOB is concerned, as you are saying, Mr Jayakumar did say that we will not be needing any additional capital infusion going forward in a time horizon of 18 to 24 months. That included the credit growth requirements of the bank for the next financial year also, ie 2016-2017. So this addition to CET 1 which is coming as 1 per cent to us, is an additional bonus. I will say it strengthens the capital adequacy of the banks but as far as lending is concerned, BOB is adequately capitalised and the capital has not been a constraint for credit growth. It is a different issue that the environment is such that the credit growth is subdued as of now.ET Now: You do not need fresh capital. This entire move will only change your tier 1 capital marginally. So at best, how does the RBI announcement change life for BOB because your tier 1 capital goes up, but that is not going to change your lending operations?VS Narang:No, that gives the headroom for an increased credit growth and to that extent I will say that because CET 1 for us increases by approximately 1 per cent, it is a significant number and it is not marginal.ET Now: You do not have a capital shortfall so even if your tier 1 capital goes up it will not translate into better or aggressive lending activity from you. I am just trying to understand the numbers here. I completely understand that tier 1 capital will go up, but if tier 1 capital goes up you can lend more or you can take more write offs. You have said that you have done bulk of the provisioning, so nothing big will happen and since you do not have a capital fall and even if your tier 1 capital goes up, commercially nothing changes for you?VS Narang:Yes, the issue of capital for the next one year or two years which any case we were telling we will not be needing. So capital cushion available to the bank for future is more.']"

In all cases, the payout will be much lower than what the government had originally budgeted for.Against dividend payments of Rs 10,433 crore from banks, financial institutions and insurers in the budget estimates for 2015-16, the government has more than halved its projections to under Rs 5,100 crore in the revised estimates.Next fiscal, it expects a pickup with payout from these entities estimated to rise nearly 37% to Rs 6,974 crore.Of this nearly a third or Rs 2,215 crore will come from LIC, the government's favourite cash cow, followed by State Bank of India (Rs 1,143 crore) andBank of Baroda(Rs 501 crore).The next fiscal will be the second year in a row when nine banks would not be making an annual payout to its shareholders, led by the government.This year, more than half of the 32 government-owned banks, FIs andinsurancecompanies are not going to pay dividends.All these entities, barring IIFCL and Bharatiya Mahila Bank, were budgeted to shell out hefty dividends during the current fiscal.

All these entities, barring IIFCL and Bharatiya Mahila Bank, were budgeted to shell out hefty dividends during the current fiscal.RBI's insistence on classifying several loans, where repayments have been irregular, has driven several state run players including Bank of Baroda, Bank of India,IDBI Bank,Indian Overseas Bankand Oriental Bank of Commerce into losses. Others such as SBI and PNB have reported a sharp fall in profits as they set aside funds to cover for potential non-payment from several companies.For long, analysts have argued that the government should seek lower dividends so that those earning profits can plough back a part of the funds to meet the capital requirements. The rise in bad debt and regulatory requirements has forced the government to provide more equity to public sector banks as the Centre has committed to maintain majority stake in these entities.""]"

Edited excerptsET Now: A lot of the metal names are doing very well.Neyveliis a case in point that has shot up;Hindalcohas a big upgrade;JSW Steelis knocking on the doors of actually trading at 52-week highs and while we talk about this calendar being skittish for the markets, it is the commodity names likeTata Steeland Vedanta which on the index are the best performers albeit from the lows that they have seen recently?Sudip Bandyopadhyay:Well what you are saying is a fact. However, the reality is I do not believe there is anything to suddenly change the view and take a complete u-turn on the metal space. We continue to remain extremely cautious in this space and I do not see any rationale for changing that view. There are stock specific reasons for movement. You mentionedNeyveli Lignite, I am sure some specific announcement is in the offing or something must have happened. Of course, most of us do not track it. So, I do not think I will be able to comment on it, but I am sure there is something stock specific. You talked about Jindal Steel, I think there are lots of good things happening specifically in that company including the proposed acquisition and things like that. So I think there are reasons for specific stock movements. Overall, it maybe something based on technicals and all but fundamentally nothing has changed in the metals and we would not change our view. We are not recommending buying metals to our investors.ET Now: Fundamentally is IDBI the best way to play banks even if you are bullish on PSU banks? Because of rate cuts and a few other things, is IDBI a preferred choice if you have a slight bent towards risk or would you take something else?Sudip Bandyopadhyay: I do not think I will take that. There are enough problems. Yes, it can be an aggressive bet considering the news flow around it --the government deciding on privatisation and the expectation that the same will happen and the bank will start doing well. So it will be a completely aggressive market news flow based bet -- not a fundamental bet though. If one has to really look at the fundamental side in a PSU bank, I probably will still go back toState Bank of India. In spite of whatever is happening on the NPA front or whatever has happened, the bank has inherent strengths and if I have to bet on a bank and maybe keep a couple of years time horizon, I will still go to State Bank of India. If I have to go for the second bank, probably it will beBank of Baroda. But I do not think I will venture out beyond that.ET Now: It is difficult to call these right because at Rs 450 or Rs 500 somebody would say I told you so. Everything was in the price. You should have bought it at Rs 1000. If it reaches there or touches Rs 800 and starts to correct, people will say hey, the business was anyway so shaky which is why it went down in the first place who told you to touch it, so the question to you is as difficult as it is, what do you do with a Just Dial which has a few question marks around its whole business model and a couple of new products which have not found that much of acceptance at least as of now?Sudip Bandyopadhyay: You are absolutely right. I think I have lot of doubts on the new products as well as the business model going forward. In fact, I think 6-8 months back I said that they need to very quickly move and start doing something which will make the company viable in the long run. They are trying and I think they are on record admitting that they are a bit delayed in doing that. And I think that is pretty much sums up the position. It was a good company, they came with a good product, it did get some traction, investor interest but they need to reinvent themselves, they need to move ahead and do things which are useful to the consumers. They are trying to evolve but I do not think they have yet reached that stage. So I do not think I will advise or I will go and buy a Just Dial yet. It is a good company. We will keep watching what they do but nothing yet, not that you should rush to exit, not that you should rush to buy in.ET Now: You tend to give some very interesting calls now and then. My question is everybody on the trading side is very bullish on aviation andJet Airwaysin particular fundamentally would you touch aviation? Indigo is off its glamour run, Jet Airways has paid some cooling off price as hasSpiceJet?Sudip Bandyopadhyay:You are absolutely right. I do not think I will like to get into aviation from a fundamental point of view right now. Whatever had to happen positive for the industry has already happened. I do not see aviation turbine fuel prices going down significantly from here. I do not see demand going beyond what we saw in the winter season, holiday season and the good season these guys reached load factor of 92-93 per cent. So overall, things are going to become a little more competitive and challenging for the industry. The valuations are also not cheap. So I would not like to get into the aviation stocks at this stage.ET Now: Your call on Infibeam subscribed or not?Sudip Bandyopadhyay:Definitely not, yes the IPO has scribed through but definitely not worth subscribing from an investors point of view. There are multiple questions on the entire space and on Infibeam as well.ET Now: How comfortable are you buying into this market considering the fact that there is an RBI policy where while the market believes that there will be a 50 bps cut, there are now increased chances that it may not be the case?Sudip Bandyopadhyay:I completely agree but that hope will keep the market alive and with a positive bias for the entire next week. I would not like to carry a position for the week after but for next week, the market will be positive. But leave that aside for a minute. There are a lot of good things happening as far aseconomyis concerned. The cement sector is definitely seeing a positive traction. You can look at midcap cement. Largecap has already moved but still opportunities exist in midcap cement. You can look at the IT names, there are a lot of things happening on the digital and IoT space. We saw what Persistent did with IBM, we are seeing whatTCSis talking about the digital. There are interesting opportunities coming inInfosys. So a couple of spaces in the market fundamentally look good and investors can start building positions if they are not already there.ET Now: It is a unique play. Tata Communication right, because there is a land bank the benefits of which only go to minority shareholders. Do not go to the Tatas because of an agreement that they had entered, but the question is that this has been in the realms of possibilities for a really long time, we have heard this VSNL land play for donkey's years. Can it finally reach a conclusion and if so, does it merit looking at?Sudip Bandyopadhyay: Definitely. I think this has been I think pending for the last 15 years almost so a conclusion would be good for the company. Yes, if it is going to be decided within the next one or two months it can be a good play for the general investors. As you rightly said, the promoters will not get any share of it. It will all belong to the minority shareholders so there can be a good play. I do not think the evaluation expectations are fully priced-in right now. So one can look at it as an aggressive bet to get into the stock at this stage.""]"

Which is why when Ravi Venkatesan, Chairman, Bank of Baroda, spoke at an industry event, the crowd was all ears. During a panel discussion, Venkatesan, who was the former India chairman of Microsoft, addressed what a business needed to stay ahead of the game. Excerpts:-The paranoid can\'t disrupt""Disruption has less to do with strategy and everything to do with leadership mindset, culture and such soft factors. For instance, it\'s rare that you are surprised by disruption, unless the management is fast asleep. You see the disruption coming long before it hits you. The interesting question to ask would be: why is it that organisations that see it coming find themselves paranoid?""-Rigidity is detrimental""Every business needs to periodically reaffirm what business they are really in. For instance, it wasn\'t that Microsoft lacked technology, resources, etc. to compete in the mobile sector. In fact, it was one of the pioneers. But the leadership mindset was that they were a PC company. And if you stick too long to that rigid definition of your identity, the world will pass you by.""-Ambidextrous is a double-edged sword""There is this emerging idea of an ambidexterous organisation. It\'s the CEO who connects the two sides. If you create this two-speed organisation, at some point, both sides have to also engage with the whole. IBM\'s big problem with the PC, 30 years ago for those who remember, was the failure to integrate the PC business.""-Out-of-the-box leadership""The problem is when we hire a leader, we look for people who are well-rounded and politically correct.

How would you view SBI?Kunal Shah:Recognition is the first step in any financial crisis even when you view it globally, but post that, what's critical is asset recapitalisation and resolution. Recognition is there because of RBIs asset quality review but we still need to see what steps are being taken in terms of resolution and recovery and doing that entire exercise in terms of quantifying the entire stress in the system and then looking at it in terms of an impact on earnings as well as on capital adequacy. We believe private players are much better and among PSU banks, SBI andBank of Barodaare pretty comfortable at the current level and current valuations.ET Now: What is interesting isICICI Bankis also rallying right now. Is there a sense that for a lot of these banks which are facing NPA pressure, this piece of news will not only benefit some of the big PSU banks but also some larger branded names in the private banking space?Kunal Shah:When you look at the broadereconomy, larger part of the stress identification has already been done and these stocks have reacted to it to that extent. So pretty much seems to be already there in terms of valuations and as I mentioned, the other critical aspects are in terms of further recapitalisation and recovery. So as and when you are seeing some kind of news on resolution of or recovery in any particular account, that is taking these stocks up. But fundamentally, you look at it in terms of valuations and say the ROA and the ROE profile which most of the banks would be able to deliver. So ICICI Bank. when you look at it even after taking say a significant hit on the credit cost which we are expecting over next three years, will still be able to deliver a return on assets of 1.6 to 1.7 odd per cent. In terms of capital adequacy, even after taking a knock on account on the stressed assets which can come in over next two-year period, the capital adequacy would still be upwards of 11 odd per cent. So when this stock has corrected to this kind of valuation even in terms of our target price, we have more than 40 per cent kind of an upside in case of ICICI.ET Now: If that is the case, if 80 per cent does indeed come by and there is a haircut of 20 per cent, how much does that really impact on the financials of banks? I would imagine that some of it would be provisioned right and that is the reason why profitability for a lot of these banks was lower this time around. So if you recover about 80 per cent, how would that trickle down in terms of the earnings of some of these banks,some of the lenders and especially and SBI,Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda for that matter?Kunal Shah:Yes. I would not like to comment in terms of one specific case ofKingfisheras such. We know that the banks have adequately provided for in terms of whatever has been recognised as NPL, but the 80 per cent recovery rate would obviously be on the higher side and you could see some kind of a provisioning write back but again, bank specific it would depend upon the kind of exposure which each of them have and also in terms of the provisioning levels in their balance sheets. But broadly, when we are doing this entire exercise, what is the probability of default and loss given default rate of some of the leveraged groups is 50-60 per cent. If recovery rate is 80 per cent odd, then obviously it seems to be slightly higher. So obviously, if the recovery rate is higher, then you could see some kind of an impact on the P&L; for banks.""]"

My sense is SBI if you see the kind of asset quality levels in the last couple of quarters they have maintained the levels admirably. As far as Bank of Baroda is concerned, Q3 was a bad quarter. They took a bigger hit than the other PSU banks and clearly the fourth quarter may not probably be as bad as the third quarter, looking at the way the government is now putting pressure on corporates, especially the wilful defaulters to pay up bad asset loans. This could be a good signal for the PSU bank because the bigger asset quality problem lies with frontline PSU banks like SBI or may be aPunjab National Bankor typically a Bank of Baroda. Clearly if the rate cut comes and the market is now looking forward to a 50 bps cut, which looks very much possible, it should be good for the PSU banks as well.

It reported slippages of Rs 5,030 crore and said it has loans of Rs 26,000 crore on its watch list. In an interview toET, Managing DirectorPS Jayakumarsays that this happened only because the bank made higher provisioning to strengthen its balance sheet and faced additionalpensionliability as well. Edited excerpts:How do you explain the fourth quarter loss after the bank said that it had cleaned up its books in the previous quarter?We took additional discretionary provision to improve our provision coverage ratio. These were not caused by incremental flow into NPAs (non-performing assets). It happened for two reasons. One, PCR (provision coverage ratio) needed to be improved and we thought that 60% is the benchmark we need to set for ourselves, so we moved forward in making it. The other reason is that we got a big boost to our capital adequacy in this quarter because of the changes in capital norms such as revaluation of real estate. Our CAR (capital adequacy ratio) jumped up sharply, so like any other person if I had extraordinary income I would use it to strengthen the balance sheet.In an interview after the Q3 results, you had said, ""We have put all uncertainty behind us and we have taken what was required as provisions...""These were brought in as additional healthy measures. None of them were unknown issues. The plan now, and I want to communicate it more strongly, is that every time we get exceptional income we intend to use it to support increased provisions orinvestmoney to grow our franchise. There were discretionary provisions of Rs 2,800 crore and there was pension liability of Rs 1,600 crore as well.Didn\'t you foresee this kind of slippages and pension liability in Q3 when you said all uncertainties had been left behind?I am not here in a witness box to justify things... from time to time whenever there is some opportunity or some unexpected flow of income you have to see how to use it. When you really look at it, we have kept our promise. We could have easily not taken these provisions and you would not have raised these questions; nobody would have raised this questions. We moved on to the latest mortality table of 2006-07 and so additional provisions were required. There are certain accruals that would have gone to P&L;, but we took a call that rather than taking it to P&L; why don\'t we strengthen our balance sheet by higher provisioning. So yes, we could have probably been less vocal and kind of hedged it but the intent was to say that whatever is there is there and we have shown it. There is no NPA and whatever needs to be provided has been provided.Why did the bank decide to make additional discretionary provisions?When we re-evaluated the situation we felt that additional provisions were necessary. Analysts\' reports that have come subsequent to Q3 have talked of adjusted book value. You see them reducing our net worth to the extent of differences in PCR (provisioning coverage ratio). So whether we do it or not, analysts are already doing it and so we decided to make additional provision to improve PCR, which was about 52% in Q3.Were there some surprises in the slippages in Q4?I won\'t say so. There were three accounts in earlier AQR (asset quality review). We took provisions for them but clients said that they were selling the company and they did not want NPA tag, so we postponed that recognition to this quarter. That should have been communicated much better. That was one piece of it. The second piece is that some accounts from non-funds based business slipped into NPA. So if you axe that out, the rest of the numbers are reasonably fine.Did you get any benefit from the pruning of the AQR list by the RBI?Trivial.What is your outlook for this fiscal?The goal is to be ahead of the industry standard and we are working on it. The nature of the beast is that the first two quarters would be muted on the revenue and elevated on NPA and the third and fourth will see reversal of NPA and elevation on revenue.How do you view the state of the economy?The growth in the balance sheet and revenue side may not necessarily be related to the growth of the economy because we hold small shares (in credit) and therefore we can grow balance sheet in consortium because we have the capital, liquidity and flexibility. But experts are saying that this year will have a good monsoon and a lot of things are done and you will see the benefit in the third and fourth quarters.']"

Any chances of more skeletons coming out of the cupboard?PS Jayakumar:Well it is like this. Fundamentally we have had a good quarter and a reasonably decent year because of balance sheet and have grown and our collections recovery has been quite outstanding. The decision to move with the higher coverage on PCR was largely in response to feedback from lot of analyst who said that at a 50-51% coverage you are not adequately positioned, so you take feedback into consideration.We also went back and look they did not ask whether the coverage was adequate now it is very difficult to pin a precise number but a higher number is better than a lower number and in all of these things what happened in the meanwhile was the rules relating to capital adequacy fundamentally changed and bring a lot of changes there.We got a huge uptick on account of that. So that gave us a freedom of action to take a higher provision on theNPAwhich is beyond the requirements of theRBIprovisioning. So if you axe out the fact that we took what we can call as discretionary provisions and match it against the loss we actually end up making 1600 crore of profit. The other provision we took was with respect to employee cost, there was a need to shift to their new table of mortality something that could have been done a couple of years before but never mind we decided to go full time catch upon that.Third we had a bunch of issues on tax and was reflect in a continuously statement of about 1400 crore of items under discussion with the tax authorities. Lot of good work done by a team and they brought it down to about 400 crore and this quarter we decided they provide for the 400 crore not withstanding the merits of a claim. So if you add all of this we took nearly 2800 crore on NPA, 1600 crore on provisions and 400-500 crore on the tax adding up to about 4800-5000 crore.Now listen reality does not change whether we take the provision or not and the reason we did it was and we always maintained that whenever we get exceptional earnings we are going to use that to strengthen the balance sheet.

In general, higher the provision coverage or lower the net NPA number the better it is.

While he spoke, the rest remained just mute spectators. But now, such meetings go on for three hours with many staff questioning what he is up to even if his responses are not convincing. For those looking for a quick turnaround at this 108-year-old lender, it is a reality check. The mission is to turn around a giant ship.Jayakumar, a former Citibanker, is the first thoroughbred private banker to head a state-run bank as the government experiments with private sector talent to revive ailing state-owned banks.On his part, he is not looking to reinvent the banking wheel, but rather is analysing the strengths and the weaknesses of the institution that many even in the banking system envy because of its franchise and conservative lending that held it back from binging on infrastructure.Bank of Baroda\'s exposure to a single entity is no more than Rs 2,000 crore, and that, in hindsight, looks to be a virtue. What is certain at this point is that the bank will be a \'universal bank\' with a suite of services ranging from corporate lending to retail to investment banking to insurance business - reflecting Sandy Weil\'s business model that made whatCitibank, Jayakumar\'s former employer, is today.Jayakumar is aided by a professional team of board of directors headed by the tech-savvyRavi Venkatesan, who ledMicrosoftin India. There cannot be a better combination than Ravi-Jay, at least on paper, for now.The performance of this combo will determine the government\'s strategy for state-run banks. ""There is no room for failure,"" says Venkatesan, who actively mingles with senior management and spends time to know the institution. ""If you can have good people in the key roles that matter, I think good outcomes are going to happen. It is mostly spending time to make sure that at least I am satisfied that the management is thinking through the people dimension.""Bank of Baroda may have the reach with over 5,300 branches and 50,000 employees across the globe, but it ails from the same problem that plagues all state-run banks - not seeking business, but wait for it to fall on its lap.And that\'s what Jayakumar is working to change. ""The public sector setup is such that we are excellent credit givers, we are excellent customer service organisations. What we don\'t do is ask for business... that is one basic change that we are proposing to do,"" says BB Joshi, executive director at Bank of Baroda.""We were only extending credit. We were not capturing transactions and cash flows... that is another paradigm shift that we are trying to bring in now. We would like to see that their transactions are captured through their accounts with us.""Public sector banks, used to the comforts of directed lending and flow of deposits, rarely chased other businesses of clients. Private peers such as HDFC Bank or Axis Bank keep customers almost captive by providing them almost every service. So, their so-called CASA (current account savings account) ratio is around 40%. Even those who borrow from Bank of Baroda will keep their salary accounts with HDFC Bank or Axis Bank. Jayakumar wants to change that.So, what are the things he\'s doing now? ""We have put a lot of milestones in the way forward and the whole theme right now is making Bank of Baroda future-ready,"" says Jayakumar without getting into specifics. ""The first thing is to protect and survive ... if your house is on fire don\'t think about how to reorganise your drawing room just douse the fire and let\'s think about the drawing room being arranged subsequently.""The plans are well laid out, but the obstacle could in convincing employees, among whom there is already a murmur that he is a control freak and may be executing his plans with lateral hires, overlooking old-timers.""Yes, they have got the intent, but it\'s easier said than done,"" says R Sreesankar, head, institutional equities, at Prabhudas Lilladher. ""The reason is that the DNA of the bank is very well laid out for a long period of time. If you try to change it, it will take a long period of time and you need the mindset of a lot of people to change. The management may think about it, but the entire people down the line... have they thought about it? Quickfixes won\'t work.\'\'But one thing Jayakumar is clear about is that he wants to rid BoB of the tag that it is no different from the other PSU banks. Differentiate is the mantra. But how? ""Differentiation could mean high-quality service, it could also mean the type of products we offer,"" he says. ""Differentiation could mean we could be as digitised or better than others. How do we leapfrog? Banks like ours have a very significant personalised service capability."" Does that mean aping successful rivals like HDFC Bank? ""If you look at HDFC Bank... their ability to be a significant retail bank, their ability to be strong on cash management... these are businesses with large profitability. I am not saying we should be like them. The chosen segments that we have taken is universal in nature.""Jayakumar, 53, gave up entrepreneurship with his mentor and friend Jerry Rao, who have ventured into affordable housing with hisVBHC Value Homes Private Ltd.

While he spoke, the rest remained just mute spectators. But now, such meetings go on for three hours with many staff questioning what he is up to even if his responses are not convincing. For those looking for a quick turnaround at this 108-year-old lender, it is a reality check. The mission is to turn around a giant ship.Jayakumar, a former Citibanker, is the first thoroughbred private banker to head a state-run bank as the government experiments with private sector talent to revive ailing state-owned banks.On his part, he is not looking to reinvent the banking wheel, but rather is analysing the strengths and the weaknesses of the institution that many even in the banking system envy because of its franchise and conservative lending that held it back from binging on infrastructure.Bank of Baroda\'s exposure to a single entity is no more than Rs 2,000 crore, and that, in hindsight, looks to be a virtue. What is certain at this point is that the bank will be a \'universal bank\' with a suite of services ranging from corporate lending to retail to investment banking to insurance business - reflecting Sandy Weil\'s business model that made whatCitibank, Jayakumar\'s former employer, is today.Jayakumar is aided by a professional team of board of directors headed by the tech-savvyRavi Venkatesan, who ledMicrosoftin India. There cannot be a better combination than Ravi-Jay, at least on paper, for now.The performance of this combo will determine the government\'s strategy for state-run banks. ""There is no room for failure,"" says Venkatesan, who actively mingles with senior management and spends time to know the institution. ""If you can have good people in the key roles that matter, I think good outcomes are going to happen. It is mostly spending time to make sure that at least I am satisfied that the management is thinking through the people dimension.""Bank of Baroda may have the reach with over 5,300 branches and 50,000 employees across the globe, but it ails from the same problem that plagues all state-run banks - not seeking business, but wait for it to fall on its lap.And that\'s what Jayakumar is working to change. ""The public sector setup is such that we are excellent credit givers, we are excellent customer service organisations. What we don\'t do is ask for business... that is one basic change that we are proposing to do,"" says BB Joshi, executive director at Bank of Baroda.""We were only extending credit. We were not capturing transactions and cash flows... that is another paradigm shift that we are trying to bring in now. We would like to see that their transactions are captured through their accounts with us.""Public sector banks, used to the comforts of directed lending and flow of deposits, rarely chased other businesses of clients. Private peers such as HDFC Bank or Axis Bank keep customers almost captive by providing them almost every service. So, their so-called CASA (current account savings account) ratio is around 40%. Even those who borrow from Bank of Baroda will keep their salary accounts with HDFC Bank or Axis Bank. Jayakumar wants to change that.So, what are the things he\'s doing now? ""We have put a lot of milestones in the way forward and the whole theme right now is making Bank of Baroda future-ready,"" says Jayakumar without getting into specifics. ""The first thing is to protect and survive ... if your house is on fire don\'t think about how to reorganise your drawing room just douse the fire and let\'s think about the drawing room being arranged subsequently.""The plans are well laid out, but the obstacle could in convincing employees, among whom there is already a murmur that he is a control freak and may be executing his plans with lateral hires, overlooking old-timers.""Yes, they have got the intent, but it\'s easier said than done,"" says R Sreesankar, head, institutional equities, at Prabhudas Lilladher. ""The reason is that the DNA of the bank is very well laid out for a long period of time. If you try to change it, it will take a long period of time and you need the mindset of a lot of people to change. The management may think about it, but the entire people down the line... have they thought about it? Quickfixes won\'t work.\'\'But one thing Jayakumar is clear about is that he wants to rid BoB of the tag that it is no different from the other PSU banks. Differentiate is the mantra. But how? ""Differentiation could mean high-quality service, it could also mean the type of products we offer,"" he says. ""Differentiation could mean we could be as digitised or better than others. How do we leapfrog? Banks like ours have a very significant personalised service capability."" Does that mean aping successful rivals like HDFC Bank? ""If you look at HDFC Bank... their ability to be a significant retail bank, their ability to be strong on cash management... these are businesses with large profitability. I am not saying we should be like them. The chosen segments that we have taken is universal in nature.""Jayakumar, 53, gave up entrepreneurship with his mentor and friend Jerry Rao, who have ventured into affordable housing with hisVBHC Value Homes Private Ltd. Although the chief executive position at a large bank is a good enough draw after working with a process-driven multinational bank with little freedom to do things at will, it is also the social responsibility that led to the choice to head Bank of Baroda.""Here is a government that says: \'listen, we want to get different sets of people because we want to make the change\'.

It reported slippages of Rs 5,030 crore and said it had loans of Rs 26,000 crore on its watch list.Jayakumar appointed a senior banker from Goldman Sachs to head itstechnologydivision, another senior executive in the risk division and sought applications from outside for the position of chief financial officer and chief risk officer.""We have a fewpeopleworking with us on the cash management side where we have little competence,"" Jayakumar toldET.

It will also provide an opportunity to the customer to maintain a consistent credit behaviour and increase his credit score to get the benefit of lower rates.Banks have used credit information companies to reduce risk in their retail loans but failed to pass on the advantage to customers.Between fiscal 2011 and 2014, while the total gross non-performing assets in the corporate sector grew by 300 basis points, non-performing loans in the retail segment fell by over 170 basis points, indicating that the use of information bureaus were one of the key drivers of retail non-performing assets.Credit information bureaus such as CIBIL in general assign rating between 300 and 900 points. Low rating is assigned to individuals who are the least trustworthy and high rating is assigned to blue chip customers.""It will remove subjectivity in decision making because it is a far more objective parameter,"" said Jayakumar.

Slippage numbers have also been lower than last quarter. Edited excerptsNow numbers are looking quite upbeat. What has led to the reduction in slippages and mild reduction in your restructured asset? Do you think the trend is here to stay?It has been generally a good quarter for us. The revenues have stayed firm despite some reduction in thebalance sheetand obviously compared to same time last year, we have more assets that are classified as NPA. So that is satisfactory. As far as the slippages are concerned, the NPA has been very stable, we have been able to recover and slippage numbers have also been lower than last quarter.The guidance numbers that we have provided marked for a potential slippage of about Rs 15,000 crore and a recovery upgradation of about Rs 10,000 crore. Half way into the year, we are less than half way as far as slippages are concerned and more than half way, as far as recoveries are concerned. So there is some elbow room with respect to what has been an earlier guidance.However, we are also working hard and are hopeful that the actual NPA number would be at the lower end of our guidance. We had indicated Rs 45,000-50,000 crore of NPA and now I think we can work towards the number being at the lower end of that guidance.In so far as other areas are concerned, our sale of non-core assets is not going to be the level we projected. We have made good progress with respect to the core business to cover that. Our operating profit will therefore be the same. We do expect to stay within the forecastreturn on equityof around 6%.You do have high exposure to stress sectors  infra, metals. Do you see any improvement here?We are looking at a provision coverage of about 65% through the NPAs as of the end of this financial year March 2017. As of now, we are at 63%. We are somewhat better placed in terms of accomplishing the provision numbers. But in the third and the fourth quarter on account of the AQR and variety of other reasons, there was a sharp spike in the NPA and there is some effect of what is called as an aging provision taking place. In summary, we are going to be at the current level of NPA, maybe a little bit around plus/minus 10% there and that is how it is looking.Our coverage ratios are looking good and in fact, this quarter we have taken a little bit more than what is required by direct norm to take into account or kind of even out the effect of the aging provision for the next quarter.What will be the impact of demonetisation on CASA, the deposit growth and overall economic activity?Well the demonetisation obviously has impacts on multiple ways and in the immediate term if you look at the last two days or working we have had, we have receipt of about Rs 12,000 crore and a savings account balance sheet grown by about Rs 9500 crore which roughly on a basis of about 7% base level.Remember, people have still not started drawing down the money that will take place once the ATMs stabilise and the cash in the system starts improving. So we have to see how it plays out. But in general, the overall view is that there would be a balance sheet growth depending upon the numbers anything from Rs 10 lakh crore to Rs 16.8 lakh crore. If we were to project that in relation to the market share of the deposits we have, saving accounts and current account balances should go by about Rs 30,000 crore to Rs 40,000 crore.Do you see demonetisation impacting interest rates and how do you see margins over the next couple of quarters?As far as interest rate is concerned, it is going to play in a multiple way. On one hand, our cost of fund is going to come down.On the other hand, we should expect interest rate reduction in the overall economy as a consequence of which the spreads on the asset side would also come off but in general in a declining environment situation or an anticipated declining rate interest environment, we have to balance our portfolio, the asset-liability mismatch in such a manner that the reduction in the interest rate would have positive effect.We have positioned the books quite well and therefore at least in the near term, the margins should either get protected or expand.']"

This could seePunjab National Bank(PNB) andBank of Barodataking over smaller lenders, said a seniorfinance ministryofficial.The government is actively looking at candidates for consolidation with the Prime Ministers Office keen on having a few large banks rather than several smaller ones, he said. We may start with some low-hanging fruit. For example, Punjab & Sind Bank can be merged into Punjab National Bank. Big lenders like Bank of Baroda can take over some turnaround banks in the southern region, like Indian Overseas Bank, the official said, adding that various permutations and combinations are being discussed. The banks couldnt immediately be reached for comment.No decision has been made as yet and these plans are only at the proposal stage.This comes as the finance ministry is working closely with the Reserve Bank of India to address non-performing assets. Last week,RBIhad unveiled stricter norms under the revised prompt corrective action framework, which may force lenders to consolidate in case they dont meet the regulatory requirements.Primarily, we are only going to be matchmakers, but, yes, if RBI feels that such action is necessitated in terms of regulatory requirements, we may act accordingly, said the official cited above, hinting that the government will also suggest options to the lenders.All these plans are fluid, as we also need to take clearances from the Competition Commission, as followed in the case of Bharatiya Mahila Bank and SBI merger, he said.State Bank of Indiaabsorbed five associate lenders and Bharatiya Mahila Bank earlier this month, boosting India's No. 1 banks financial muscle.The government will push large state-owned lenders to tap the markets this fiscal, another government official said. Under the Indradhanush road map, banks were to raise Rs 1.8 lakh crore from the markets for capitalisation, he said. We expect large banks to explore that route.That money will be needed as the government has allocated just Rs 10,000 crore toward capital infusion in banks this fiscal.Indradhanush is a seven pronged revamp plan for state-run banks that the government announced in 2015.It included a programme to deal with bad debt and called for capital infusion to the tune of Rs 70,000 crore till FY19.The government will also push seven public sector banks  United Bank of India, Indian Bank, Bank of Maharashtra and Central Bank of India among them  to tap the markets in the next five months to meet the 25% public shareholding norm.The government is also looking to allow lateral entry in banks and will work closely with the Banks Board Bureau to reform the human resource structure at the state-owned lenders.The latest development appears to be a broader plan than the one that Banks Board Bureau chief Vinod Rai alluded to in an interview with Reuters last month. He had suggested that two large Mumbaibased banks could potentially merge in the current financial year.""]"

Edited excerpts:ET Now: Considering the cabinet has now cleared the ordinance to amendBanking Regulation Actthis would augur very well for you considering you as well are quite burdened with bad loans?Ashok Kumar Garg:That is perfectly fine and I feel this will help the banks to resolve their biggest challenges nowadays but the fact of the matter is we need some more details of the package to take a view but the good thing is that the constitution of the or the provision to have more oversight committees to view the decision, to review the decision taken by the banks will definitely help the banks to resolve those issues little more efficiently and more quickly.Second thing what I look at is, I mean, the powers of RBI to provide more haircuts to the banks will also help to resolve issues because in case of large cases where banks are really finding it difficult to go ahead because of the policy constraints such type of measures are required whereby we can clean up our books and take a pragmatic view to go forward.ET Now:The proposed amendments seek to empower banks to resolve large NPAs and protect them for loan decisions taken in good faith if this comes do you think it would be a big relief for bankers who are currently shying away from taking such tough decisions?Ashok Kumar Garg:Yes, I feel definitely it helps the banks to take some bold steps because what happens because of the policy constraints and the provisions available in the schemes which are available as of now, at times as I said banks are required to take more haircuts in the larger interest of the bank stress. What happens till now banks were also having this inherent, I would like to say sort of fear, so the constitution of the more oversight committees and as I said review by them the decision taken by the banks board, I mean, it will definitely help the bank to take more pragmatic decisions and to take in forward.ET Now: Who will decide the value of the asset, the entire process that is going to be a very complicated process?Ashok Kumar Garg:Definitely. See the fact of the matter is when banks have to take a view obviously most of these accounts where what we are talking about is the consortium accounts involving huge amount of money, involving large number of bankers and you rightly said that it is a complicated process because when we have to go for evaluations, valuations, haircut to what extent, looking to the present status.The emerging state of a particular entity obviously we take the help of the best possible consultant available in the field, in the eco-space and thereafter those issues are discussed amongst all the banks. And based on a consensus only the decisions are taken.The fact of the matter is it is not that banks were not eager to help but issues were even in some of the cases they wanted to take some pragmatic decisions but they were constrained by the present policy.I am pretty sure with more leeway to the banks, more leeway to the regulator which in turn can help the banks, it will definitely I am sure will have some more I would like to say it will facilitate the banks to resolve those issues a little more quickly.']"

What have been the key drivers? Which have made you jump into the black this quarter?We have been working on transformation. Last year was a terrible year so we have to keep that in mind while comparing numbers.The real story is the quarter to quarter change. We have seen a significant growth particularly in the advances. We grew close to 11% on the domestic side and around 5.8% on the international side adjusted forexchange ratewith the rupee appreciating pretty much close to 10% so that has been good. TheNPAnumbers have largely remained to the forecast and the guidance we have given. Coverage ratios have improved and absolute amount of net NPA number has declined; so overall it is a fairly positive story.Your gross NPA guidance for the full year rose from 43 to 46. Optically it may look up but if your gross NPA guidance is at 46 that means that at a net level we should see a marked improvement?You can create a range of scenarios. One scenario that we all wanted to be is the resolutions of the large accounts happen and then a lot of changes has been done with respect to the rules and regulations. Also all banks have moved up in the maturity curve, in terms of dealing with non-performing accounts so if that scenario plays out then obviously the results are going to look good but in all our thought process we need to think about what could be a scenario if things do not hold out as a promise seems to be. So I would not at this point of time say more than this except to say that in a scenario where things do not work out exactly to the script we are looking at a Rs 3000 crore of further deterioration from this point of time.What could go wrong? What is your biggest fear right now when you make these assumptions on your NPAs?We are not expecting anything terribly to go wrong in the context of the recovery aspect. There could be a range of scenario from an extremely positive outcome to something that may not be that positive. But in so far as the risk in a financials are concerned there are couple of large accounts which still have not NPA but could potentially become one. There may be some challenges with some of the smaller accounts but by and large I think we should be on course as far as managing the portfolio is concerned.For PSU banks, the large stressed pockets are power, infrastructure and to a large extent metal companies. The cycle there is reviving are you getting a sense that you will be able to benefit from that?If you look at the sector, the cycle is improving. The EBITDA number per tonne of steel and other measures are all moving up but we still have to see that translate in the form of payment to the banks of the instalment and the principal portion.Tell me what is the exposure at the top 30-40 accounts that the government has identified for resolution?In general, Bank of Barodas exposure to any of these large accounts is not more than say 2% of the total lending. The total borrowing those companies have in the market. We do not have any single company exposure that is beyond Rs 2000 crore. Ours is a fairly diversified portfolio so the outcome of the top 50 is not something that really worries us. If you look at our numbers we have around Rs 10000 crore of restructured assets that is an area to watch for and then outside of that we have what Rs 3000 to 4000 crore of loans that large ticket loans that we need to watch for but we are not so much vulnerable to the overall top 50 by virtue of the way the exposures have been taken.How much provisioning have you made for these top 50 accounts?Our total provision ratio is close to 58%. We have reasonably well provided with respect to all our accounts so I think the ability to accept the haircut and move on is pretty much. We are well positioned for that effect and we have been working to that and therefore we are quite comfortable overall in a provision coverage sense obviously the less we lose the better it is.You were earlier highlighting that aside of these large top 30-40 accounts there are also some smaller companies that you do fear could turn NPA tell us what sectors these are in?We were discussing broadly what could go wrong and when we discuss about that we have to discuss about a range of outcomes. So far as the larger accounts are concerned, those issues are now well known and understood, some actions have been taken and we have as far as possible been able to absorb as much as coverage is possible and hoping that as and when the resolutions happen we are well position to take the haircut and move on.As far as the smaller accounts are concerned they are largely in the SME sector, they are granular, they are distributed, and therefore the managing of that is very different from managing of the larger portfolio. It has to be a much more effort across the organisation and that is really what it is. It is a much more distributed portfolio and therefore the managing of the risk of the distributed portfolio is quite different from managing NPAs on large accounts but to that process we have set across a fairly strong centralised credit process so we have a central collection I mean call centre and collection process.We are building a lot of behavioural score to anticipate stress ahead of it comes and so we are also preparing for the fact that if the accounts risk with the accounts of large accounts are kind of identified and kind of parameterised then we need to ask what are the kinds of risk that exist in the balance sheet and then we need to prepare for them if we are not already been prepared. So the management of the small account is very much been there and we are getting better at it.You have already guided for a figure for your gross NPAs where do you see your net NPAs headed?I do not want to it is too early to give a certain number all I am trying to say by saying we are going to have about Rs 3000 crore on gross NPA. We are looking at the Rs 3000 crore NPA as a maximum downside that might exist from this point of time.My understanding of your top 50 NPA accounts is that that is at 150 billion you have only provided for about 75 to 76 billion what happens to the remaining?Our coverage ratio is close to 54% on the top 50 accounts and many of these top 50 accounts have plant and machinery, production facility etc. So across the portfolio we do not have a loss of greater than 50% and it is an extremely conservative interpretation.If it moves up by 4% or 5%, we still have the ability to be able to absorb it by virtue of the organic capital we are generating. So the NPA numbers and all of that are kind of embedded in our portfolio much of this happened before I came. We are focussing on the growth because sooner than later the growth would be back on the agenda and therefore we are preparing ourselves for the growth story.With this existing gross NPA guidance, do you see a repeat of what missed the mark approach?We had indicated a kind of a slippage of about Rs 15000 crore and a recovery number of Rs 10000 crore and a forecast between Rs 45000 to Rs 50000 crore that was pretty much there from the very starting point. Now the flow of provisions and flow of accounts into NPAs not a linear or it cannot be very consistent quarter to quarter some of them as you know they are lumpy accounts and then when things move they could be high in one quarter it has kind of slower and less in the next quarter so you cannot kind of take the number and divide by 4 and say you done a great month and you done a bad month, it is not so you got to look it over a period of time and when we look at over the period of time across all indicators we had indicated something like 11000 crore on operating income of pre-provisions earnings operating income.We are within the range with respect to the NPA forecast we have done so I think the assumption that the point you are making that there has been inconsistency is exist in the sense that the NPA numbers, the movement on the NPA numbers have not been equal across each quarter but that is a very nature of these accounts and the way they collectively behave. So come back to the point I think we must what I am trying to say is listenWe are now trying to switch ourselves to get into a growth mentality, we got our transformation programme going, it is gathering momentum and then we are getting ourselves future ready. There are some legacy problems that exist and they continue to remain till fully resolved; we are taking provisions and covering them. There can always be a negative and a nasty surprise but we are well protected. We have absolute amount of uncovered NPAs of Rs 18000 crore only and our operating income is fairly strong to be able to take any kind of risk that happen.We are not looking for any other infusion or support from the government as far as capital is concerned; down the year we might need more capital but that would be growth capital and that is good capital to raise. So overall we are fairly in comfortable position. There could be volatility but we are going to come out strong during the course of this year.When do you think corporate growth will come back?We as a bank need to keep focussing on reducing the competitive gap between us and the best of competitors. We must aspire to be ahead of the industry curve and towards this end we have to do the kind of changes that are required whether it is with respect to technology or process or people capability. It is a two-three years exercise and we are making progress.The second thing is overall themacroeconomicsare looking good, monsoon is expected to be normal given all of these things and the macroeconomic stability we should look at an overall pick up in the economic growth and together we need to, we would like to see our share of the growth as well.Three the way the banks are today structured and the fact that clients are more and more wanting to do with fewer institutions than 20 banks in the consortium we see an obvious consolidation opportunity being there which should push up the credit growth.Finally as far as corporate credit is concerned we have grown by about 11% on a sequential basis and that is a good number as we know the first and two quarters of every year turns out to be a little bit slower than it starts picking up and so we expect that cycle to somewhat remain. So overall our sense is our corporate portfolio should grow partly on account of the fact that the market itself will be growing and also because there is enough opportunity for us to increase themarket sharebecause of the low level of exposures we have on most accounts and also because of the kind of consolidation that we see happening with large clients preferring to work with fewer banks.There are downside risks as is the case everywhere we have to manage them but for all the things that can go wrong we have adequate operating income to take care of the downside so we have to watch this space and we need to keep moving on the path we have set ourselves in.']"

Now the flow of provisions and flow of accounts into NPAs not a linear or it cannot be very consistent quarter to quarter some of them as you know they are lumpy accounts and then when things move they could be high in one quarter it has kind of slower and less in the next quarter so you cannot kind of take the number and divide by 4 and say you done a great month and you done a bad month, it is not so you got to look it over a period of time and when we look at over the period of time across all indicators we had indicated something like 11000 crore on operating income of pre-provisions earnings operating income.We are within the range with respect to the NPA forecast we have done so I think the assumption that the point you are making that there has been inconsistency is exist in the sense that the NPA numbers, the movement on the NPA numbers have not been equal across each quarter but that is a very nature of these accounts and the way they collectively behave. So come back to the point I think we must what I am trying to say is listenWe are now trying to switch ourselves to get into a growth mentality, we got our transformation programme going, it is gathering momentum and then we are getting ourselves future ready. There are some legacy problems that exist and they continue to remain till fully resolved; we are taking provisions and covering them. There can always be a negative and a nasty surprise but we are well protected. We have absolute amount of uncovered NPAs of Rs 18000 crore only and our operating income is fairly strong to be able to take any kind of risk that happen.We are not looking for any other infusion or support from the government as far as capital is concerned; down the year we might need more capital but that would be growth capital and that is good capital to raise. So overall we are fairly in comfortable position. There could be volatility but we are going to come out strong during the course of this year.When do you think corporate growth will come back?We as a bank need to keep focussing on reducing the competitive gap between us and the best of competitors. We must aspire to be ahead of the industry curve and towards this end we have to do the kind of changes that are required whether it is with respect to technology or process or people capability. It is a two-three years exercise and we are making progress.The second thing is overall themacroeconomicsare looking good, monsoon is expected to be normal given all of these things and the macroeconomic stability we should look at an overall pick up in the economic growth and together we need to, we would like to see our share of the growth as well.Three the way the banks are today structured and the fact that clients are more and more wanting to do with fewer institutions than 20 banks in the consortium we see an obvious consolidation opportunity being there which should push up the credit growth.Finally as far as corporate credit is concerned we have grown by about 11% on a sequential basis and that is a good number as we know the first and two quarters of every year turns out to be a little bit slower than it starts picking up and so we expect that cycle to somewhat remain. So overall our sense is our corporate portfolio should grow partly on account of the fact that the market itself will be growing and also because there is enough opportunity for us to increase themarket sharebecause of the low level of exposures we have on most accounts and also because of the kind of consolidation that we see happening with large clients preferring to work with fewer banks.There are downside risks as is the case everywhere we have to manage them but for all the things that can go wrong we have adequate operating income to take care of the downside so we have to watch this space and we need to keep moving on the path we have set ourselves in.']"

As per estimates, in some states the default rate has increased by up to 50 per cent in recent months. In this scenario, Bank of Baroda would also likely be impacted by Agri-loan defaults, which will be a drag on its profitability.Bank merger is an overhang as a weak bank saddling with BOB may impede margins, CRAR: The government is working towards overhaul of the PSB space and consolidation amongst PSBs is also a likely measure. Bank of Baroda is relatively better placed in terms of asset quality and capital adequacy as compared to some of likely candidates for consolidation. Hence, a merger of BOB with a significantly weaker player (if announced) notwithstanding the likely synergy benefits (to accrue over a longer period), in the near term, it may be performance dilutive for BOB.NPA resolution steps - may entail near term earnings impact due to higher provisions: RBIâs decision to expedite 12 cases of corporate loan defaults and enforce speedy resolution is a long term positive and a welcome step. However, in the near term, lenders may have to take significant haircuts in the process of selling off or other measures implementation to resolve the NPLs. Hence, in the near term, it may weigh upon on banksâ profit performance.Outlook: BoBâs performance in Q4FY2017 were a mixed bag with absence of a significant negative surprise on asset quality front (despite a slow pick-up in business) being the key positive. However, in the event of a merger with a weak bank, or increased provisions for NPA resolutions may impact margins and return ratios going forward.

Our reengineering exercise with respect to the bank and the transformation is going on quite well. We do see picking up of the operating profit happening during the next three quarters. As far as NPAs are concerned, at this point of time, we are still holding on to our earlier guidance and we do hope that in the next three quarters we would see an improvement.ET Now: I must ask you about the exposure to the 12 IBC accounts as we have been asking a lot of thePSU banks. What is your exposure, what are the kind of provisions you have made?PS Jayakumar:We have 10 accounts, not 12. I think the overall exposure to that account is around Rs 7,200-7,300 crore level. We have a 52% or 53% coverage and left to themselves and assuming these accounts do not get resolved, the aging provision which is budgeted would take care of whatever is the requirement between the current level of provision and theRBIguidance on the same. So that gap is around Rs 800 odd crore. But it is kind of factored in our scheme of things through the aging provision that would happen during the course of this year assuming these accounts do not get resolved.ET Now: Can you share some numbers, guidance and slippages going forward?PS Jayakumar:When we look at our net NPA numbers, we still remain the outlier in the public sector bank system in the sense with a little bit of asset growth that we expect to happen. We expect the asset growth to be at the 15% range this year. I do think the overall net NPA number would therefore start coming down. We would also be taking some provisions during the course of this year. So overall I see an improvement in the case of NPA numbers.']"

Naidoo didnât answer a call made to his mobile phone seeking further information.âThis has not been afforded by the Bank of Baroda to enable these companies to transfer their banking facilities to a new bank, but rather has occurred in the context of the ongoing litigation between the parties,â Naidoo said. âNo other bank has agreed to offer them alternative banking services.âBloomberg on Tuesday reported that the family had told the Vadodara, India-based bank that theyâve found another company willing to offer them banking services, citing a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the matter was confidential.A Mumbai-based spokesman for Bank of Baroda didnât immediately respond to an email and two calls to his office on Thursday.Mines, TV NewsThe Gupta family controls businesses in South Africa ranging from coal mines to newspapers, a computer business and a 24-hour news channel and have previously said bank account closures could affect their ability to pay about 7,000 employees.The familyâs businesses lost their other South African banking relationships after lenders including Barclays Africa Group Ltd. and Standard Bank Group Ltd. said they risked falling foul of regulators and the law by continuing to offer services to the family and their companies.The Bank of Baroda has significantly wound down activities related to the family, P.S.

The bank, which has been in partnership with Uber, wants to reach 10% of Uber\'s estimated 2.5 lakh active drivers. ET reported earlier this year thatState Bank of IndiaandAxis Bankwere among lenders that had stopped offering car loans toOlaand Uber drivers. Payment defaults by drivers had also led to many of their cars being seized.However, Bank of Baroda says delinquency among cab drivers has been on par with its auto portfolio. ""Our pilot of lending to Uber drivers in nine cities since January has been running well, with close to 500 cars financed, and we are now deciding to scale it up,"" said Akhil Handa, head of fintech and new business initiatives at Bank of Baroda. He said the programme was started by CEO PS Jayakumar to support the government\'s ""Standup India, Startup India"" initiative.""In ordinary course, these borrowers would not be able to secure funds from the banks. The assessment of these drivers is made possible due to an alternate scorecard and our tie-up with Uber,"" Handa said. The bank recently started a training programme for aspiring cab drivers and coached 900 people who wanted to take up driving as a vocation in Pratapgarh, Uttar Pradesh, from where they are inducted by Uber. ""Given the strong demand from riders, we are seeing sustainable earning opportunities for driver partners and are committed to supporting them. We are constantly working with several banks and NBFCs to find terms most attractive for driver partners,"" an Uber spokesperson said.Some lenders that have pulled out of the segment, including digital platformIndifi, have no plans to revive loans for cab drivers. ""We noticed that across this segment, the incomes were inflated. Driver incomes declined significantly once incentives came down and the NPAs (non-performing assets) began to rise,"" said Siddharth Mahanot, cofounder of Indifi. ""We stopped lending to this segment and do not intend to start any time soon.""Executives from Axis Bank and SBI also said there were no plans to start lending to this segment again. Handa said Bank of Baroda could extend its programme to platforms such as Ola provided it can ""replicate the arrangement and are confident of the earnings trajectory they are willing to let their driver-partners earn.""Analyst said Bank of Baroda\'s loan book is still small and the real test will come when it scales up.Bank of Baroda\'s auto loans of Rs 4,511 crore accounted for 1.53% of its domestic credit in the three months ended June, according to a company presentation to analysts. ""Firstly, 500 loans is not a big number and is not representative of the market at large. Most other banks have seen loan default troubles with the drivers,"" said Abdul Majeed, partner atPwC India.""In this case, they (Bank of Baroda) might have seen a handful of a few hundred drivers repaying loans and felt positive about it, many of whom work 14 hours or more and are managing to repay the loans, but then again this is a small number.""(With inputs from Pratik Bhakta & Shashwati Shankar)']"

The central bank declined to comment.OUTAâs Chief Operating Officer Ben Theron said on Wednesday the organization has asked its attorneys to inquire if its allegations prompted another investigation into Bank of Baroda, but they havenât yet had an answer on the matter.The Guptas had their accounts closed by South Africaâs four biggest banks last year because the lenders were concerned they would fall foul of regulations aimed at combating money laundering and other financial crimes.In the 10 months through July 2017, Bank of Baroda reported 36 suspicious and unusual transactions related to the Guptasâ accounts with a combined value of over 4.25 billion rand to South Africaâs Financial Intelligence Centre,Manoj KumarJha, head of the Bank of Barodaâs South African unit, said in court papers filed in August.After the central bankâs fine, the Bank of Baroda told the Guptas and their companies on July 6 that their accounts would be terminated within 11 days and all loans recalled by the end of September.

The central bank declined to comment.OUTAâs Chief Operating Officer Ben Theron said on Wednesday the organization has asked its attorneys to inquire if its allegations prompted another investigation into Bank of Baroda, but they havenât yet had an answer on the matter.The Guptas had their accounts closed by South Africaâs four biggest banks last year because the lenders were concerned they would fall foul of regulations aimed at combating money laundering and other financial crimes.In the 10 months through July 2017, Bank of Baroda reported 36 suspicious and unusual transactions related to the Guptasâ accounts with a combined value of over 4.25 billion rand to South Africaâs Financial Intelligence Centre,Manoj KumarJha, head of the Bank of Barodaâs South African unit, said in court papers filed in August.After the central bankâs fine, the Bank of Baroda told the Guptas and their companies on July 6 that their accounts would be terminated within 11 days and all loans recalled by the end of September.

The fraudsters had managed to open fictitious accounts in the name of the statutory organisation in the above five banks and operated the accounts mainly for encashing cheques/demand drafts/postal orders of which they were not the rightful owners, for periods ranging from one month to two years, without being detected by the banks.A scrutiny was undertaken in the above five banks in January, 2014 to ascertain the adherence to extant regulatory instructions by banks in the instant case. The findings of the scrutiny revealed violation of certain regulatory guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank, namely:non-adherence to certain aspects of know your customer Know Your Customer(KYC) norms like customer identification and acceptance procedure.internal norms regarding customer identification procedure of a bank being violative of Know Your Customer (KYC) directions issued by Reserve Bank\xa0non-adherence to instructions on monitoring of transactions in customer accounts.Based on the findings of the scrutiny, the Reserve Bank issued a show cause notice to each of these banks, in response to which the individual banks submitted written replies. After considering the facts of each case and individual bankâs reply, as also, personal submissions, information submitted and documents furnished, the Reserve Bank came to the conclusion that some of the violations of serious nature were substantiated and warranted imposition of monetary penalty as determined above on two banks, namely, ICICI Bank Ltd. and Bank of Baroda. Failure on the part of these banks to take timely remedial measures had aggravated the seriousness of the contraventions and their impact.In respect of the three remaining banks, namely, State Bank of India, Axis Bank Ltd. and State Bank of Patiala, where such scrutinies were conducted and banksâ explanation called for, based on written and oral submissions, it was decided not to impose any monetary penalty as the banksâ explanations regarding the circumstances which led to the fictitious accounts getting opened and operated without detection, was judged to be reasonable. However, these banks have been cautioned to put in place appropriate measures and review them from time to time to ensure strict compliance of Know Your Customer (KYC ) requirements in future.']"

Of these slippages, INR 12 bn stood as one-off whereas INR 38 bn emerged from across business segments; corporate, MSME and agri. While corporate slippages at INR 13.5 bn stood higher, the recoveries here too stand equally strong.

Provisions at INR 20 bn too stood elevated reporting as high as 234% Y-o-Y increase denting the bottom-line of the bank. The stress for the bank primarily emerged from beleaguered sectors; viz, iron and steel and power and to a certain extent retail loans. SMA 2 accounts amounted to INR 110 bn ;i.e. 3% of the overall advances, but this exposure declined sequentially by 16%.Given the rich liability franchise, strong liquidity management, capital sufficiency and higher PCR levels, we maintain a positive long term outlook on BoB. While a strong upside from here on stands limited in near term primarily due to the prolonged clean-up and consolidation exercise, the structural growth story is only going to better from here on; we reiterate ACCUMULATE stance on the stock. That said, the stock can be bought at lower levels, given that the bank stands as one of the better retail franchise better placed in the PSU space.

""But with the basic premise intact, the asset cycle likely bottoming - and about the only govt bank offering a changed & differentiated promise, would view any dips on the back of the q as enhanced buying opportunities,"" it says in a note.On an optimistic note, it reiterates that asset quality cycle, business transition and thereafter the return to decent growth & profitability is a longer journey, and the start has been made.Deutsche Bankhas downgraded it to hold rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 150 per share factoring in higher non-performing loans (NPL) provisions and lower growth.

However, can investors ignore 70 per cent of the banking system? Even if one excludes cash-starved weak banks, there are three large state-owned banks they cannot ignore State Bank of India(SBI),Punjab National Bank(PNB) andBank of Baroda(BoB). The three constitute 35-40 per cent of the banking system. This argument is more valid now, as stock prices of PSBs have fallen 27 per cent so far, after last years euphoria settled. Most analysts believe BoB is the best among bigger PSBs.From valuation to quality of loan book, there are several reasons why BoB scores over the others. According to Societe Generale Cross Asset Research, SBI and BoB stand out among PSBs, with less than five per cent restructured assets. Over two years, nearly half the restructured book is expected to turn into non-performing loans and BoB looks good from this point of view, as its recast book is lower compared to others.The bank has a diversified loan book, which has protected it from sharper deterioration than peers.', 'Thanks to higher slippages in the December quarter, BoBs gross non-performing asset ratio rose to 3.85 per cent, while restructured assets stood at 5.9 per cent of credit. Despite the weak performance in the quarter, ICICI Securities believes the bank still has an advantage over peers in terms of a well-diversified book, healthy capital adequacy, provision coverage ratio, and current and savings account profile.The management recently met analysts and conveyed while it expected the Reserve Bank of India to cut another 50 basis points over nine months, it might not cut base rate anytime soon. It plans to do so when the impact on net interest margin (NIM) is neutral. According to Karvy, the bank would see an increase in international NIMs, which will support the decline in domestic NIMs due to a base rate cut.The valuations have turned rather attractive after the recent correction in stock price. Its shares have fallen six per cent over six months. Deutsche Bank Markets Research, in its note dated April 1, says: We are turning more positive on PSBs, given their distress valuations, which now factor low (8-12 per cent) RoE (return on equity) and extremely high credit costs perpetually. We prefer larger names such as SBI, PNB, BoB. BoB is currently trading at one time its adjusted book value (FY17), which analysts believe factors in all the negatives.']"

Both gross non-performing assets (NPA) and net NPA ratios improved sequentially. While gross NPA fell 13 basis points sequentially to 3.72 per cent, net NPA contracted 22 basis points sequentially to 1.89 per cent. Fresh slippages, which stood at Rs 1,359 crore were the lowest in the four quarters of FY15. Higher provisioning (up 44 per cent sequentially and 57.6 per cent year-on-year) to Rs 1,818 crore aided asset quality ratios to some extent. The jump in provisions was largely due to a 134 per cent year-on-year surge in provisioning towards NPAs and bad debts written off, to Rs 1,491 crore. While the Street cheered the banks improving asset quality, sustained improvement in this metric is some time away. Part of the share price gains could also be attributed to the near 15 per cent fall between May 5 and 8.The BoB management continues to witness stress in the environment and indicated that improvement in asset quality in the quarter was better than expectations.', ""The management stated more restructured assets were struggling to become solvent and asset quality pressure was unlikely to ease over the next six months.Slowing loan growth, weak net interest income (NII), higher provisions and tax rate impacted BoB's net profit in the March quarter, which fell 48.3 per cent year-on-year to Rs 598 crore. This was 37 per cent below Bloomberg consensus estimate of Rs 955 crore. Although BoBs domestic net interest margin were down slightly due to falling domestic yields, NII grew a mere 1.5 per cent year-on-year to Rs 3,172 crore. This was its lowest growth since the September 2013 quarter and was impacted by weak loan growth of 7.8 per cent, which again is the lowest in the past 8-10 quarters. Analysts including Vaibhav Agrawal of Angel Broking, however, believe banks having seasoned loan book are more likely to witness early improvement in asset quality trends. He believes BoB is well placed in this light and the asset quality improvement outweighs the miss on net profit in the quarter.Other income fell marginally to Rs 1,295 crore in the quarter, owing to weak recoveries from prudentially written-off accounts. The recovery was down 83.44 per cent at Rs 60 crore and negated a four-fold year-on-year rise in trading gains at Rs 360 crore. The bank's tax rate jumped from 18 per cent in year-ago quarter to 31.7 per cent on account of discontinuation of reduction of deferred tax allowed earlier. The tax rate is likely to remain elevated.""]"

While it prides itself as Indias international bank, its branch presence in Indias neighbourhood has been weak.This plan seems to be in tune with the governments strategy to scale up economic, trade and commercial relations with all nations with which India shares its borders.The bank is forming a project office to pilot changes including stepping up share in remittances and starting an international trade finance branch. In a communication to employees, Ranjan Dhawan, managing director and chief executive officer of the bank, said it is surprising that the bank is poorly represented in Indias neighbourhood. The bank should examine the possibility of having a presence at least in Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, he noted.Other large public sector banks such as State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank have presence in South Asian countries. SBI operates branches in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka and has joint ventures in Nepal and Bhutan.Delhi-based Punjab National Bank has a joint venture in Nepal  Everest Bank  with 20 per cent shareholding and 51 per cent stake in Bhutanese bank Druk PNB Bank.During FY15, BoBs overseas business contributed 32.47 per cent to its total business. The total business of the bank stood at Rs 10,45,625 crore at the end of March 2015. The overseas business had 22.98 per cent share in the banks gross profit.BoBs overseas advances grew 9.10 per cent to Rs 1,36,195 crore at the end of March 2015 from Rs 1,24,837 crore in March 2014.', 'Of the total overseas loan book, 53.1 per cent was buyers credit. The syndicated loans and external commercial borrowings (mostly to Indian companies) were 23 per cent and local credit had 23.9 per cent share in the overseas loan book.The banks exposure to non-India related companies was 27.4 per cent of its overseas loan-book at the end of March 2015. The banks international presence covered 24 countries through its 104 branches/offices.Making the case for a re-look at the way BoB conducts its international business, Dhawan said: We pride ourselves in being Indias international bank. However, our operations worldwide resemble a giant treasury. Only in Dubai do we have some sort of a proper banking presence. Therefore, we intend to ensure all products and services of Bank of Baroda are available globally.He made a strong case for broad-basing activity, going beyond banking with only ethnic Indians. In Kenya, despite having 12 branches in a full-fledged subsidiary, the bank does not have either the debit card or mobile banking facility.If we are to be a truly global bank, we must cater to the local population also. This year, we intend to start projects for having an international services branch to attract remittances, which should be at least 10 per cent of the countrys share instead of three to four per cent as at present, he said.IN THE OFFING']"

In order to better serve this segment of customers, BoB has decided to formulate a business plan for opening a wholly owned subsidiary, the lender said a statement.The board of the bank held a meeting to review strategy, business plan for the current financial year (2015-16) and a vision statement for 2020.A BoB executive said while there was a surge in the number of accounts under the financial inclusion plan, the bank would like to maintain and improve the quality of services.The bank was careful about not hampering normal operations at branches due to an increase in customer base and workload.', 'Hence, the bank was exploring the idea for a separate entity to manage the financial inclusion business, the official said.The Mumbai-based public sector lender is also changing its strategy for alternate channels. It will focus on increasing the number of cash recyclers instead of automated teller machines (ATMs). More than 2,500 such machines are planned to be installed during the current year in addition to 100 e-Lobbies, it said.The bank had a network of 8,030 ATMs, 390 cash recyclers and 151 e-Lobbies, besides 5,190 branches in domestic operations at end of March 2015.The bank also plans to add 50,000 point of sales machines during the year.For strengthening its overseas operations, the bank is considering commencement of banking operations in neighbouring countries in Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar.It is also looking to open representative offices in Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, Canada and Russia.']"

Two other premises were also searched - the residences of two bank officials allegedly involved in the case.A CBI spokesperson said the agency had registered a case against 59 current account holders and unknown bank officials on a complaint by Bank of Baroda.The case is being jointly investigated by the CBI, the Enforcement Directorate and the Serious Fraud Investigation Office.""It was alleged 59 current account holders and unknown bank officials conspired to send overseas remittances, mostly to Hong Kong, of foreign exchange worth about Rs 6,000 crore in an illegal and irregular manner, in violation of established banking norms, under the garb of payments towards suspected non-existent imports,"" read a CBI statement.The bank, on its part, has suspended two officials for allegedly being involved in Rs 6,172-crore illegal foreign exchange transactions.The case has also led to political mudslinging, with the Opposition Congress tearing into the central government. Former Union minister and Congress leader R P N Singh said, ""In one and a half years the prime minister and his government were able to get back only Rs 4,144 crore of black money and from one bank alone, Rs 6,172 crore has gone out. This could not have been done without somebody (powerful) knowing about it. The PM makes tall speeches about no scandals in his regime and about checks and balances in place. This belies his claims.""The bank\'s executives said the event had caused reputational loss, adding the lender was internally investigating a failure of information technology systems to put up alerts for such high-value transactions.The unearthing of the alleged scam comes at a time P B Jayakumar is slated to take charge as BoB\'s chief executive and managing director on Tuesday (October 13). In August, Jayakumar, a former Citibank executive, was picked for the post from private sector firm VBHC Value Homes, where he was managing director and chief executive.The bank had been without a full-time CEO for 14 months and this had hit operations, including monitoring, officials said. Currently, BoB has only one full-time executive director, B B Joshi.Ranjan Dhawan, former managing director and CEO in-charge, retired from the post on September 30. The last full-time CMD was S S Mundra, who took charge as Reserve Bank of India (RBI) deputy governor in July.In August, K V Rama Moorthy, another executive director, was abruptly moved to Kolkata-based United Bank of India.BoB executives said in the recent past, some episodes had hit the bank\'s image.', 'First, RBI had approved a 70-million dirham loan to the troubled Atlas Jewellery Group by the bank\'s Dubai branch. Following this, the government transferred executive director K V Rama Moorthy, as he was heading the Dubai branch at that time. Had he stayed with the bank, it could amount to conflict of interest, RBI had told the government.In addition, there was an alleged bill-discounting scam in Gujarat. Early this month, the bank had detected Rs 350 crore of irregularities in bill discounting - though the bills were discounted, the payment is pending.An internal investigation by the bank showed Rs 6,172 crore was sent from India to Hong Kong for the import of cashews, pulses and rice, but nothing was imported and the money was deposited in 59 bank accounts of several companies.For the transaction, bank officials did not take proforma invoices and no documents were obtained showing whether the goods were received from Hong Kong or not, it was said.It came to the notice of the bank that in 2014-15, its Ashok Vihar branch recorded unusually high forex transactions of Rs 21,528 crore, against Rs 45 crore in 2013-14, primarily due to advance remittances for imports by newly opened current accounts. Between August 1, 2014, and August 12, 2015, 8,667 transactions were conducted.In one case, a company had made 408 remittances amounting to Rs 170 crore. The total remittances from the branch amount to Rs 6,172 crore.In one of the ""major irregularities"" noticed by the bank, Rs 451,67,550 was transferred from a customer account and credited to an office account to make the balance \'nil\' on July 14 this year. The bank noted the same company ""hadn\'t made any remittances through our Ashok Vihar branch"". It added such entries were taking place on a daily basis.After an inspection, the bank found there were 245 manual entries of suspicious nature in the Consul Office account since December 2014. Even when customer accounts did not have sufficient balances, advance remittances were made.For instance as on April 24 this year, the opening balance for a company was Rs 123.35 lakh; the account was credited Rs 392.62 lakh but the amount it transferred was Rs 1,124.66 lakh. The amount transferred from the office account was Rs 623.15 lakh.Citing several such examples, the inspection report stated the matter should be investigated in detail.WHAT BoBS INTERNAL AUDIT SHOWED']"
