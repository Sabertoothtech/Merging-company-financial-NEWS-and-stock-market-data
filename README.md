# Merging-company-financial-NEWS-and-stock-market-data

We label the news with quant data regression line slope value.
So for that we first open the news file and checked its date-time, now that date-time is searched in quant data. If the time is present in market hours of stock market then the text is labeled with slope value of regression line.Else if news is not in market hours then closing value of previous day and opening value of current days' regression line acts as its label.
